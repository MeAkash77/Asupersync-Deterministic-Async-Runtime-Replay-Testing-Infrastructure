# Decision Plane Validation Contract

Bead: `asupersync-1508v.2.6`

## Purpose

This contract defines deterministic validation scenarios for decision-plane controller operations: shadow execution, canary gating, promotion pipeline, rollback drills, hold/release lifecycle, evidence-ledger completeness, and controller-composition safety. It ensures that controller rollout cannot bypass verification gates, that failed rollouts produce actionable recovery commands, and that multiple adaptive controllers do not silently fight over shared telemetry or knob surfaces.

## Contract Artifacts

1. Canonical artifact: `artifacts/decision_plane_validation_v1.json`
2. Smoke runner: `scripts/run_decision_plane_validation_smoke.sh`
3. Invariant suite: `tests/decision_plane_validation_contract.rs`

## State Transition Model

Controllers follow a strict promotion pipeline:

```
Shadow --> Canary --> Active
  ^                    |
  |   (rollback)       |
  +--------------------+
  ^         ^
  |  Hold --+ (blocks promotion, release restores prior mode)
  +--- Fallback (any rollback activates fallback flag)
```

Valid transitions:
- `Shadow -> Canary` (requires calibration >= threshold AND epochs >= min_shadow_epochs)
- `Canary -> Active` (requires calibration >= threshold AND epochs >= min_canary_epochs)
- Any mode -> `Hold` (operator-initiated investigation pause)
- `Hold -> (prior mode)` (release restores mode before hold)
- `Canary/Active -> Shadow` (rollback on regression, budget, manual, or fallback)

Invalid transitions:
- `Shadow -> Active` (must pass through Canary)
- `Hold -> (any promotion)` (must release first)

## Rollback Contract

Rollback always targets Shadow mode. Each rollback reason produces a `RecoveryCommand` with:

1. Controller identity (ID, name)
2. Mode transition (from, to)
3. Rollback reason with structured payload
4. Policy ID governing the decision
5. Snapshot ID at time of rollback
6. Actionable remediation steps

Rollback of a controller already in Shadow is a no-op (returns `None`).

## Evidence Ledger Contract

Every state transition MUST produce an `EvidenceLedgerEntry` containing:

- Sequential entry ID
- Controller ID
- Snapshot ID (when available)
- Event type (Registered, Promoted, RolledBack, Held, Released, Deregistered, PromotionRejected, DecisionRecorded)
- Policy ID
- Timestamp

Promotion rejections are also recorded, ensuring the ledger captures both successful and failed attempts.

## Structured Logging Contract

Decision-plane operations MUST emit structured logs including:

- `controller_id`: Controller under operation
- `controller_name`: Human-readable name
- `mode`: Current controller mode
- `previous_mode`: Mode before transition
- `policy_id`: Promotion policy governing the operation
- `calibration_score`: Current calibration score
- `epochs_in_mode`: Epochs spent in current mode
- `budget_overruns`: Accumulated budget overruns
- `decision_label`: Label of the decision being recorded
- `snapshot_id`: Snapshot ID for the operation
- `verdict`: Outcome of the operation
- `rejection_reason`: Why a promotion was rejected
- `rollback_reason`: Why a rollback was triggered
- `fallback_active`: Whether fallback is currently active
- `recovery_command`: Recovery command payload (on rollback)
- `ledger_entry_count`: Total ledger entries for this controller
- `active_controller_set`: Controllers participating in a composition replay
- `shared_telemetry_fields`: Shared evidence fields read by a controller pair
- `shared_knob_surfaces`: Shared knob surfaces written by a controller pair
- `timescale_ratio`: Faster-to-slower update ratio for a composed controller pair
- `compose_verdict`: `safe` or `do_not_compose`
- `safe_mode_precedence`: Which controller wins if conservative fallback must dominate
- `oscillation_detected`: Whether the replay observed contradictory action churn

## Controller Interference Contract

The canonical interference matrix is embedded under `controller_interference_matrix` in
`artifacts/decision_plane_validation_v1.json` with schema version
`controller-interference-matrix-v1`.

It freezes:

1. A controller catalog with explicit inputs, outputs, fallback mode, and update cadence.
2. Pair-level rules for shared telemetry fields, shared knob surfaces, precedence, and
   timescale-separation statements.
3. A deterministic safe pair:
   - `scheduler_recommend + brownout_guard`
   - shared telemetry: `ready_backlog_p95`
   - shared knobs: none
   - safe-mode precedence: `brownout_guard`
   - minimum faster/slower cadence ratio: `4`
4. A deterministic forbidden pair:
   - `tail_risk_admission + admission_steering`
   - shared telemetry: `ready_backlog_p95`, `tail_latency_p99`
   - shared knob: `admission_window`
   - verdict: `do_not_compose`

The proof harness emits an operator-readable composition report with:

- env fingerprint (`host_class`, `worker_count`, `memory_gib`, `evidence_stream_id`, `lab_runtime`)
- active controller set
- knob writes derived from the decision trace
- fallback activation counts
- decision trace entries with ledger ticks
- decision-rate mismatch summaries when cadence assumptions are violated
- fallback churn counts when conservative fallback toggles repeatedly
- explicit `safe` or `do_not_compose` verdict per scenario
- exact conservative-baseline retention when required evidence is missing
- explanation of why the pair is allowed or blocked

Deterministic replay scenarios currently required:

1. `AA023-CONTROLLER-INTERFERENCE-STABLE`
   - scheduler retuning stays 4x slower than brownout feedback
   - no oscillation
   - no fallback churn
2. `AA023-CONTROLLER-INTERFERENCE-FORBIDDEN`
   - same-knob admission pair is rejected before replay
   - emits rejected pairing and `do_not_compose`
3. `AA023-CONTROLLER-INTERFERENCE-OSCILLATION`
   - scheduler retuning illegally collapses to the same cadence as brownout decisions
   - emits decision-rate mismatch, oscillation detection, and fallback churn
4. `AA023-CONTROLLER-INTERFERENCE-MISSING-EVIDENCE-FALLBACK`
   - shared evidence is missing
   - emits conservative-baseline retention with no composed action applied

## Comparator-Smoke Runner

Canonical runner: `scripts/run_decision_plane_validation_smoke.sh`

The runner reads `artifacts/decision_plane_validation_v1.json` and emits:

1. Per-scenario bundle manifests with schema `decision-plane-validation-smoke-bundle-v1`
2. Aggregate run report with schema `decision-plane-validation-smoke-run-report-v1`
3. Timeout-bounded execute-mode diagnostics:
   - `timeout_seconds`
   - `command_exit_code`
   - `timeout_observed`
   - `rch_remote_success_observed`
   - `required_log_markers`
   - `missing_log_markers`
4. Required marker checks for every scenario so an `rch` wrapper success cannot hide
   missing proof output.
5. `passed_after_rch_retrieval_timeout` when the remote cargo command finished
   successfully, every required marker is present, and only `.rch-target` artifact
   retrieval timed out locally.
6. For `AA023-SMOKE-CONTROLLER-LEDGER`, deterministic exported controller-state artifacts:
   - `.decision-plane-validation-smoke-artifacts/run_*/AA023-SMOKE-CONTROLLER-LEDGER/controller_snapshot_ledger.json`
   - `.decision-plane-validation-smoke-artifacts/run_*/AA023-SMOKE-CONTROLLER-LEDGER/controller_snapshot_planner_rows.json`
7. For `AA023-SMOKE-CONTROLLER-INTERFERENCE`, deterministic composition artifacts:
   - `.decision-plane-validation-smoke-artifacts/run_*/AA023-SMOKE-CONTROLLER-INTERFERENCE/controller_interference_matrix.json`
   - `.decision-plane-validation-smoke-artifacts/run_*/AA023-SMOKE-CONTROLLER-INTERFERENCE/controller_interference_report.json`

Examples:

```bash
# List scenarios
bash ./scripts/run_decision_plane_validation_smoke.sh --list

# Dry-run one scenario
bash ./scripts/run_decision_plane_validation_smoke.sh --scenario AA023-SMOKE-TRANSITIONS --dry-run

# Execute one scenario
bash ./scripts/run_decision_plane_validation_smoke.sh --scenario AA023-SMOKE-TRANSITIONS --execute --timeout-seconds 240

# Execute controller-composition proof
bash ./scripts/run_decision_plane_validation_smoke.sh --scenario AA023-SMOKE-CONTROLLER-INTERFERENCE --execute --timeout-seconds 240
```

## Validation

Focused invariant test command (routed through `rch`):

```bash
rch exec -- env CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_decision_plane_docs cargo test --test decision_plane_validation_contract -- --nocapture
```

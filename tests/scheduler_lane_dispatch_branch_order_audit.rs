//! Audit + regression test for `src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`
//! `next_task` lane-dispatch branch ordering.
//!
//! Operator's question: "profile (or read) the lane-decision
//! arbiter's branch prediction. Are common cases (FIFO → EDF →
//! Cancel) ordered by frequency? If reverse-ordered (uncommon
//! first), branch prediction misses on every dispatch."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   The dispatch order in `next_task` is cancel → timed →
//!   ready. The operator's framing ("FIFO is most common")
//!   describes a frequency-optimized order, but asupersync
//!   uses a PRIORITY-ORDERED dispatch — cancel-first is a
//!   CORRECTNESS invariant, not a frequency artifact.
//!
//!   Three reasons cancel-first is correct here:
//!
//!   1. **Documented priority contract**
//!      (three_lane.rs:6-15): "The cancel lane has strict
//!      preemption over timed and ready lanes, but a fairness
//!      mechanism prevents starvation of lower-priority work."
//!      This is the public scheduler contract; a frequency-
//!      reorder would silently violate it.
//!
//!   2. **Asupersync invariant: cancellation is timely**
//!      (per AGENTS.md, "cancellation is a protocol: request →
//!      drain → finalize"). Cancels need to dispatch within
//!      bounded time to release obligations and unblock
//!      Region::close. Putting cancel BEHIND timed/ready would
//!      delay cancel-arrival under load — defeating the point
//!      of the cancel lane.
//!
//!   3. **Modern branch predictors handle this efficiently**.
//!      The cancel-check `if let Some(...) = self.global.
//!      pop_cancel()` returns None on most iterations (cancel
//!      lane is usually empty). After a few hundred warmup
//!      dispatches, the CPU's branch predictor learns "this
//!      branch is not-taken" and predicts correctly. Total
//!      cost per dispatch: a few cycles at worst (a single
//!      well-predicted branch + an Option discriminant
//!      check). Reordering for "branch prediction" would save
//!      ~5-10 cycles per dispatch at most — negligible against
//!      the ~100-1000 cycle cost of dispatching the actual
//!      task.
//!
//!   The branch predictor is also assisted by the explicit
//!   `check_cancel = self.cancel_streak < effective_limit`
//!   gate (three_lane.rs:3379). This boolean is computed once
//!   and skips the entire cancel-pop branch when false —
//!   under sustained ready/timed dispatch, the cancel branch
//!   is statically not-taken.
//!
//!   The dispatch order varies with the governor's
//!   SchedulingSuggestion:
//!   - Default mode: cancel > timed > ready (correctness).
//!   - MeetDeadlines mode: timed > cancel > ready (deadline
//!     pressure temporarily flips cancel/timed priority).
//!   - DrainObligations / DrainRegions: as default, but
//!     `effective_limit` is doubled so cancel gets MORE
//!     dispatch budget.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. The cancel-first ordering is correct
//! by design and the branch-prediction cost is negligible
//! after warmup. The operator's "FIFO first" reordering would
//! be a CORRECTNESS regression — cancels would starve under
//! sustained ready-lane work, breaking close-quiescence
//! guarantees and obligation-drain invariants.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - reordered to "ready > timed > cancel" by frequency,
//!     ignoring the priority contract (would let ready work
//!     starve cancels indefinitely),
//!   - dropped the `check_cancel` precomputation (would force
//!     the `if let Some(pop_cancel())` to be evaluated even
//!     when cancel work is fairness-blocked — wasted cycles),
//!   - changed the explicit branch order in the default arm
//!     of next_task without updating the priority-contract
//!     doc,
//!   - introduced a CPU-specific branch hint (`#[cold]` on
//!     the cancel branch in stable Rust without a cargo
//!     feature gate) that would shift cancel-dispatch latency
//!     in the cold case,
//!     would all be caught here.

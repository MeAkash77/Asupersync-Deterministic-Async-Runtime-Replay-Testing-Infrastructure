//! Audit + regression test for `src/grpc/streaming.rs` and
//! `src/grpc/client.rs::ResponseStream` flow-control under server
//! pushback (tick #136).
//!
//! Properties audited:
//!
//!   (a) **No infinite buffering — VERIFIED.**
//!       `MAX_STREAM_BUFFERED = 1024` (streaming.rs:474) is enforced
//!       on every `push` path:
//!         * `StreamingRequest::push_result`     (streaming.rs:535)
//!         * `cfg(test) ResponseStream::push`    (streaming.rs:747)
//!         * production `client::ResponseStream::push` (client.rs:827)
//!       All three return `Err(Status::resource_exhausted(...))` once
//!       `items.len() >= MAX_STREAM_BUFFERED`. Buffer is bounded.
//!
//!   (b) **Client gets back-pressure signal — VERIFIED.**
//!       The Err is typed as `Code::ResourceExhausted` with the
//!       message `"... buffer full — apply backpressure"` so a
//!       sender can pattern-match the back-pressure signal.
//!
//!   (c) **Documented gap (P3): no buffer-fullness query API.**
//!       Producers cannot proactively self-pace; they must try
//!       `push` and react to `Err`. There is no
//!       `buffer_len()` / `is_full()` / `poll_ready()` accessor
//!       (`grep -n 'pub fn buffer_len\\|pub fn is_full\\|pub fn poll_ready'`
//!       returns zero hits in streaming.rs / client.rs). This is
//!       a doc-truthfulness item; the back-pressure path itself
//!       works.
//!
//!   (d) **Documented gap (P3): cap is `pub(crate)` only.**
//!       `MAX_STREAM_BUFFERED` is not re-exported from
//!       `asupersync::grpc`, so operators cannot read or override
//!       the value without forking. Future enhancement could
//!       expose it as a public const or make it per-stream
//!       configurable.
//!
//! Regression tests below pin (a) and (b) via the public push API
//! without depending on the exact constant value (they discover
//! the cap by behavior so a future tuning to a different value
//! still passes).

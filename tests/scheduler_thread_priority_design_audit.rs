//! Audit + regression test for thread-priority configuration
//! and Linux SCHED_FIFO real-time scheduling.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when configured for real-time
//! priority, do we attempt SCHED_FIFO (correct: deadline-
//! bounded) and fall back gracefully if not permitted?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   asupersync **DELIBERATELY DOES NOT use OS-level
//!   real-time scheduling**. There is no SCHED_FIFO,
//!   sched_setscheduler, setpriority, or nice-value
//!   manipulation anywhere in src/. Worker threads spawn
//!   via plain `std::thread::Builder::new().name(...).
//!   stack_size(...).spawn(...)` (runtime/builder.rs:333)
//!   at OS-default priority. This is **SOUND BY DESIGN**
//!   for six concrete reasons:
//!
//!   1. **Cross-platform**: SCHED_FIFO is Linux-specific.
//!      asupersync supports Linux + macOS + Windows + WASM.
//!      A Linux-RT-only deadline mechanism would silently
//!      degrade on other platforms — and the deadline-aware
//!      contract must hold on every platform.
//!
//!   2. **Permission requirements**: SCHED_FIFO requires
//!      `CAP_SYS_NICE` or root. Standard server / container
//!      / CI deployments do NOT grant these by default. A
//!      runtime that depended on SCHED_FIFO would need
//!      either fallback paths (defeating the bound) or
//!      hard-fail at startup (defeating portability).
//!
//!   3. **`#![deny(unsafe_code)]` discipline** (per AGENTS.md):
//!      `libc::sched_setscheduler` requires `unsafe`. Adding
//!      it would require a per-function `#[allow(unsafe_code)]`
//!      and a documented carve-out — the project's audit
//!      record (audit_index.jsonl) shows zero unsafe code in
//!      the runtime/scheduler/ tree, by deliberate choice.
//!
//!   4. **System-stability hazard**: A SCHED_FIFO thread
//!      that spins (e.g., a tight checkpoint loop — see
//!      tests/scheduler_checkpoint_tight_loop_dos_audit.rs)
//!      starves ALL other processes on the system, including
//!      init/systemd/the kernel's own watchdog. asupersync's
//!      cooperative-yield contract becomes a load-bearing
//!      kernel-stability invariant under SCHED_FIFO — a
//!      bug that previously surfaced as a slow task becomes
//!      an OS hang.
//!
//!   5. **Deadline-aware behavior is achieved cooperatively**:
//!      asupersync's deadline guarantees come from FIVE
//!      MECHANISMS already audited and pinned: cooperative
//!      budget (poll_quota / cost_quota / deadline), the
//!      Lyapunov governor's MeetDeadlines suggestion, EDF lane
//!      priority (Timed > Cancel > Ready under MeetDeadlines),
//!      multi-worker dispatch, and timed_fairness_limit's
//!      bounded EDF-vs-FIFO interleaving even under sustained
//!      pressure.
//!      None of these depend on OS thread priority.
//!
//!   6. **User extension point exists**: if a specific
//!      deployment wants OS-level RT priority, the runtime
//!      provides `RuntimeBuilder::on_thread_start(|| { ... })`
//!      (runtime/builder.rs:2446). User code can call
//!      `libc::sched_setscheduler` from this callback —
//!      with their own `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` and their
//!      own privilege management. asupersync neither
//!      requires nor blocks the choice.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND BY DESIGN**. The framing of the
//! operator's question contains a category error: asupersync's
//! deadline-aware spec does NOT depend on OS RT scheduling.
//! Pinning a SCHED_FIFO attempt would actually be a
//! REGRESSION — it would (a) only work on Linux, (b)
//! require unprivileged-fallback complexity, (c) introduce
//! unsafe code, (d) create system-stability hazards.
//!
//! What the audit DOES pin:
//!   - No OS RT scheduling code anywhere in src/ (forbid
//!     a regression that adds SCHED_FIFO without explicit
//!     design discussion).
//!   - Worker threads spawn via plain
//!     std::thread::Builder with no priority manipulation.
//!   - The on_thread_start / on_thread_stop callbacks
//!     exist as the user-extension point for those who
//!     genuinely need OS RT priority.
//!   - Cross-references to the cooperative-deadline-mechanism
//!     audits that DO carry the deadline-aware contract.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - added a `with_realtime_priority(SchedFifo)` method
//!     to RuntimeBuilder that called libc::sched_setscheduler
//!     (would introduce unsafe code, OS-stability hazards,
//!     and cross-platform divergence — needs explicit
//!     design discussion before merge),
//!   - added a default-on SCHED_FIFO attempt at startup
//!     (would hard-fail under unprivileged deployments — a
//!     widely-deployed app would break for many users),
//!   - removed the on_thread_start callback (would lose
//!     the user-extension point — users who genuinely need
//!     OS RT priority lose the opt-in mechanism),
//!   - replaced the std::thread::Builder.spawn with a
//!     SchedPolicy-aware spawn that silently swallowed
//!     errors (would mask permission failures and produce
//!     confusing behavior — RT was requested but not
//!     applied),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

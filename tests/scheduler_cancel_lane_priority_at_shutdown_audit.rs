//! Audit + regression test for `src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`
//! cancel-lane drain ordering relative to shutdown and to the
//! deadline-monotone (timed) lane.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when runtime.shutdown() is called, must
//! cancel-lane be drained before deadline-monotone? Per close-
//! quiescence invariant, all cancellations must complete before
//! close returns."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   The asupersync close-quiescence invariant is **enforced at
//!   the REGION close layer**, NOT at scheduler shutdown. Per
//!   AGENTS.md: "Region close = quiescence: no live children +
//!   all finalizers done." Scheduler shutdown happens AFTER all
//!   regions have closed quiescent — by then, the cancel lane
//!   is already empty.
//!
//!   The scheduler-level `ThreeLaneScheduler::shutdown()`
//!   (three_lane.rs:1811-1814) is intentionally minimal:
//!
//!   ```ignore
//!   pub fn shutdown(&self) {
//!       self.shutdown.store(true, Ordering::Release);
//!       self.wake_all();
//!   }
//!   ```
//!
//!   It signals workers and wakes parked workers; the workers'
//!   `run_loop` (three_lane.rs:3164) exits at the next
//!   iteration of `while !self.shutdown.load(...)`. No explicit
//!   "drain cancel lane before exiting" phase is needed because
//!   the upper layer (Region::close) has already drained all
//!   live tasks and their cancellations.
//!
//!   The actual cancel-lane DISPATCH priority during normal
//!   operation lives in `next_task`
//!   (three_lane.rs:3358-3470+):
//!
//!   - **Default mode** (most common): the dispatch order is
//!     `cancel > timed > ready`. Phase 1 checks the global
//!     cancel queue first; Phase 2 checks the local cancel
//!     lane before timed. The operator's primary concern
//!     ("cancel-lane drained before deadline-monotone") is
//!     satisfied by this ordering.
//!
//!   - **MeetDeadlines mode** (Lyapunov governor signals
//!     deadline pressure): the priority temporarily flips to
//!     `timed > cancel`, but cancel is still bounded by the
//!     `cancel_streak < effective_limit` fairness check that
//!     forces a cancel dispatch after at most
//!     `cancel_streak_limit` consecutive non-cancel
//!     dispatches. This prevents starvation while letting
//!     deadline-critical work meet its deadlines.
//!
//!   - **DrainObligations / DrainRegions modes** (governor
//!     signals an obligation/region drain is in progress): the
//!     `effective_limit` is doubled
//!     (`base_limit.saturating_mul(2)`, three_lane.rs:3372),
//!     giving cancel work twice the per-streak budget — the
//!     drain phase needs cancel-lane progress most.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. Two converging guarantees enforce the
//! operator's "all cancellations complete before close" rule:
//!   1. **Close-quiescence at the region layer**: by the time
//!      Region::close returns, all child tasks have completed,
//!      their cancellations have finalized, and the cancel
//!      lane is observably empty.
//!   2. **Cancel-lane priority during normal operation**: in
//!      the default dispatch mode, cancel lane is checked
//!      BEFORE timed lane in both global and local phases.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - swapped the default-mode cancel-then-timed order to
//!     timed-then-cancel (would let cancels starve under
//!     timed pressure even outside MeetDeadlines mode),
//!   - removed the `cancel_streak < effective_limit` fairness
//!     check (would let a flood of cancels starve all timed
//!     work — opposite failure mode but still wrong),
//!   - made `shutdown()` non-idempotent or block waiting on a
//!     drain (would deadlock if regions were already
//!     quiescent),
//!   - removed the `wake_all()` from shutdown (would let
//!     parked workers sleep forever),
//!     would all be caught here.

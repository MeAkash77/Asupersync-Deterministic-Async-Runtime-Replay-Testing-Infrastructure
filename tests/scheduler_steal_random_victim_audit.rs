//! Audit + regression test for `src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`
//! work-stealing victim selection randomization.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when worker-A's local queue is empty, does
//! it steal from a randomly-selected neighbor (good) or always from
//! worker-A+1 (queue contention hotspot)?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   The asupersync 3-lane scheduler implements work stealing in
//!   TWO complementary forms, both with randomized victim
//!   selection:
//!
//!   1. **`ThreeLaneWorker::try_steal`** (three_lane.rs:4140+) is
//!      the primary in-worker steal path. Two phases, both
//!      starting from a RANDOM index:
//!
//!      a. **Fast path** (line 4142-4165): scans
//!      `self.fast_stealers` (other workers' LocalQueues). Start
//!      index is `self.rng.next_usize(len)` — a fresh random index
//!      per call. Iteration is `(start + i) % len` (circular). Each
//!      call attempts `len` victims at most.
//!
//!      b. **Slow path** (line 4172-...): scans `self.stealers`
//!      (other workers' PriorityScheduler heaps) for ready-lane
//!      theft. Same random-start circular pattern. Uses `try_lock`
//!      so contended victims are skipped without blocking.
//!
//!      The random `start` per call ensures that worker A is
//!      EQUALLY likely to probe worker A+1, A+2, … A-1 (mod
//!      worker_count) FIRST. There is no static "always probe
//!      worker A+1 first" hotspot.
//!
//!   2. **`scheduler::stealing::steal_task`** (stealing.rs:16-72)
//!      is the dedicated load-balancing helper, available for
//!      callers that want **Power of Two Choices** (Mitzenmacher
//!      2001) instead of linear probing. It:
//!      - Picks two distinct random victims via
//!        `rng.next_usize(len)` twice (with collision dedup).
//!      - Compares their `stealable_len_hint()` to prefer the
//!        more-loaded queue.
//!      - Falls back to the second candidate, then to a
//!        random-start linear scan over remaining victims.
//!
//!      Both paths use `DetRng` so the randomization is
//!      DETERMINISTIC per seed (replay tests work) but UNIFORM
//!      across seeds (no hotspot).
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. Worker A's victim probe order is
//! independently randomized per steal attempt; there is NO
//! "worker A+1" hotspot. The randomization is via `DetRng` so
//! it remains deterministic for replay tests while breaking
//! adjacent-worker contention in production.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - replaced `let start = self.rng.next_usize(len)` with
//!     `let start = self.id.0 + 1` or any function of worker
//!     id (would re-introduce the hotspot — every worker
//!     always probes its successor first),
//!   - removed the modulo so iteration stopped at index 0
//!     (would only scan a contiguous suffix),
//!   - dropped the `self.rng` advance (would freeze the start
//!     index at a constant — same hotspot pattern, just at a
//!     different fixed worker),
//!   - dropped the `try_lock` skip in the slow path (would let
//!     contended victims block the stealer, defeating the
//!     "skip and try the next" defense),
//!   - replaced DetRng with a non-deterministic source
//!     (would break replay tests but not the load
//!     distribution itself),
//!     would all be caught here.

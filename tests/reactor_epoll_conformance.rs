//! Linux epoll semantics conformance tests.
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive conformance testing for Linux epoll
//! behavior as exposed through [`EpollReactor`] and the `polling` crate. The
//! tests cover the trigger modes and hangup behaviors that this wrapper relies
//! on for correct async I/O operation:
//!
//! 1. **ET fires exactly once per state transition** (epoll(7) §Edge-triggered interface)
//! 2. **Partial reads leave socket armed** (epoll(7) §When to use edge-triggered)
//! 3. **EPOLLONESHOT triggers at most once then disarms** (epoll(7) §EPOLLONESHOT)
//! 4. **Current EPOLLEXCLUSIVE wrapper limitation is documented**
//! 5. **Mixed default-oneshot + ET registrations within one reactor are honored**
//! 6. **EPOLLRDHUP signals half-close** (epoll(7) §EPOLLRDHUP)
//!
//! # Linux epoll(7) Edge-Triggered Semantics
//!
//! **Edge-triggered interface (EPOLLET):**
//! - Events are delivered only when the state of the file descriptor changes
//! - After receiving an event, the application must read/write until EAGAIN
//! - Failure to exhaust the fd means subsequent ready data won't trigger events
//!
//! **EPOLLONESHOT:**
//! - File descriptor is disabled after the event is received
//! - Must call epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_MOD) to re-enable
//! - Prevents spurious wakeups in multi-threaded applications
//!
//! **EPOLLEXCLUSIVE:**
//! - Ensures only one thread gets woken up for the same event
//! - Avoids thundering herd when multiple threads wait on the same fd
//! - Linux kernel 4.5+ feature for scalable servers
//!
//! **EPOLLRDHUP:**
//! - Peer closed its write side (half-close detection)
//! - Allows detection of TCP FIN without reading until EOF
//! - Linux 2.6.17+ feature for efficient connection tracking

//! Audit + regression test for `src/observability/otel.rs` OTLP
//! exporter timeout drop-on-expiry semantics.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when exporter.send() exceeds timeout, is
//! the in-flight batch dropped (correct: don't queue indefinitely)
//! or held forever (memory leak)?"
//!
//! Audit chain:
//!
//!   (a) **Per-request timeout is configurable** via
//!       `OtlpHttpExporter::with_timeout(timeout: Duration)`.
//!       Default is 10 seconds in `OtlpHttpExporter::new`.
//!       The timeout bound is applied PER request_once attempt,
//!       not per overall batch — so a batch that retries N
//!       times has a worst-case wall-clock of
//!       `(timeout + retry_delay) × max_retries`.
//!
//!   (b) **`crate::time::timeout` wraps the HTTP request**
//!       inside `send_request_with_compression`. The wrapped expression returns a
//!       `TimeoutFuture<F>` (src/time/timeout_future.rs:47-61)
//!       which holds the inner future as a `#[pin]`-projected
//!       field. When `TimeoutFuture` resolves to `Err(Elapsed)`,
//!       the `.await` consumes the wrapper; dropping the
//!       wrapper drops the inner future, which cancels the
//!       in-flight HTTP request and releases the cloned
//!       `body.to_vec()` captured by the async block.
//!
//!   (c) **Timeout maps to `OtlpError::non_retryable`**
//!       Timeout errors map to:
//!       `.map_err(|_| OtlpError::non_retryable("OTLP request
//!         timeout"))?`
//!       This is NOT a retryable error class. The retry loop's
//!       `Err(e)` (non-retryable) arm in `send_otlp_protobuf`
//!       returns IMMEDIATELY — no further retry attempts on
//!       timeout. The outer `request_body: Vec<u8>` then goes
//!       out of scope at function return, freeing the memory.
//!
//!   (d) **No queue / pending buffer absorbs the timed-out
//!       batch**. Verified by the prior retry-queue audit
//!       (`tests/otel_otlp_retry_queue_bounded_audit.rs`):
//!       OtlpHttpExporter has no `pending_batches` /
//!       `retry_buffer` / `VecDeque<Vec<u8>>` field, no
//!       background dispatcher, no `flush()` state to drain.
//!       So the failed-on-timeout batch has nowhere to go
//!       except out-of-scope.
//!
//!   (e) **`TimeoutFuture::poll` semantics** (timeout_future.rs:
//!       252-283): on timeout, `*this.timed_out = true` AND
//!       `*this.completed = true` are set, then `Err(Elapsed)`
//!       is returned. A second poll on the same TimeoutFuture
//!       returns `Err(Elapsed)` again (fail-closed). The inner
//!       future is NOT polled after timeout — preventing a
//!       situation where a slow inner future continues to
//!       allocate while a parent caller has already moved on.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. The in-flight batch is dropped on
//! timeout via three converging mechanisms:
//!   1. `TimeoutFuture` cancellation: drop semantics propagate
//!      to the inner HTTP request future.
//!   2. Non-retryable error class: timeout does not loop back
//!      into the retry path that would re-allocate.
//!   3. No queue / no buffer / no background dispatcher: the
//!      timed-out batch has no pending state to live in.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - replaced `crate::time::timeout(...)` with a sleep + race
//!     pattern that didn't drop the inner future,
//!   - changed the timeout error mapping from
//!     `OtlpError::non_retryable` to `OtlpError::Retryable`
//!     (would loop and re-allocate the body),
//!   - introduced a queue that absorbed timed-out batches for
//!     "later",
//!   - made the inner request future hold the body in an
//!     `Arc` shared with another long-lived structure (so
//!     drop on the future would not free the body),
//!     would all be caught here.

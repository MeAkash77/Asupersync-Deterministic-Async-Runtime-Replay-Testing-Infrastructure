//! Audit + regression test for the (non-existent)
//! `.detached()` orphan-spawn API.
//!
//! Operator's question: "Cx::detached() spawn semantics:
//! when a task is spawned with .detached() (orphan-
//! permitted), does it correctly outlive parent region
//! (intentionally) or follow parent (defeating purpose)?
//! Per asupersync, if detached API exists it must truly
//! orphan."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   asupersync **does NOT have a `.detached()` spawn API**
//!   that creates a task outliving its parent region. This
//!   is **intentional and structurally correct** — the
//!   structured-concurrency invariant forbids orphan-
//!   outlives-parent semantics. Per AGENTS.md asupersync
//!   non-negotiable invariants:
//!
//!     "Structured concurrency: every task/fiber/actor is
//!      owned by exactly one region.
//!      Region close = quiescence: no live children + all
//!      finalizers done."
//!
//!   An orphan-permitted detached task would defeat both
//!   invariants — region.close() could not reach
//!   quiescence if a "detached" task were still running
//!   under (or outside) the region.
//!
//!   The operator's "detached" mental model applies to
//!   tokio (where detach-on-drop creates orphan tasks
//!   tied to the runtime, not to a region). asupersync
//!   has NO such concept by design.
//!
//!   What asupersync provides for fire-and-forget:
//!
//!   1. **`TaskHandle` drop without await** (detached at
//!      the HANDLE level, NOT the region level): the task
//!      continues running but remains bound to its parent
//!      region. When the region closes, the task is
//!      cancelled.
//!      - Pinned in
//!        tests/runtime_join_handle_drop_lifecycle_audit.rs.
//!
//!   2. **Long-lived top-level tasks**: spawn at the root
//!      region; the root region only closes when the
//!      runtime shuts down. Effectively "outlives" any
//!      transient parent — but still owned by SOME region
//!      (the root).
//!
//!   What asupersync DELIBERATELY does NOT provide:
//!
//!   - **Orphan tasks with no region** — would violate
//!     "every task owned by exactly one region".
//!   - **Outlive-parent-region detach** — would violate
//!     "region close = quiescence".
//!   - **Tokio-style `task::spawn` returning ()** — every
//!     spawned task in asupersync produces a TaskHandle
//!     bound to a region.
//!
//!   The chain of structural enforcement:
//!
//!   1. **`Scope::spawn` requires a Scope** (cx/scope.rs:348):
//!      ```ignore
//!      pub fn spawn<F, Fut, Caps>(&self, state: &mut RuntimeState, ...) -> ...
//!      ```
//!      The `&self` is a Scope — which holds a RegionId.
//!      Every spawn anchors to a region.
//!
//!   2. **`create_task_record` adds the task to the
//!      regions task_ids list** (cx/scope.rs):
//!      ```ignore
//!      if let Some(region) = state.region(self.region) {
//!          region.add_task(task_id)?;
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      The region OWNS the task — there's no orphan
//!      pathway.
//!
//!   3. **Region close cancels owned tasks** (state.rs:
//!      cancel_request second pass): cancel_request walks
//!      `region.copy_task_ids_into(&mut task_id_buf)` and
//!      calls `request_cancel_with_budget` on each. No
//!      task escapes region close.
//!
//!   4. **`can_region_finalize` checks all tasks
//!      terminal** (state.rs:2785): `all_tasks_done = ...
//!      task.is_terminal()`. The region cant close until
//!      every owned task reaches a terminal state.
//!      Detached-outlive-parent would be IMPOSSIBLE under
//!      this contract.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND BY DESIGN**. The operators "detached"
//! framing maps onto a non-existent API. Adding one would
//! violate two non-negotiable structured-concurrency
//! invariants from AGENTS.md.
//!
//! No bead filed. The "missing feature" is INTENTIONAL —
//! the audit pins the structural enforcement that prevents
//! a future regression from introducing it.
//!
//! For users who want fire-and-forget semantics:
//!   - Use spawn at the root region (long-lived parent).
//!   - Drop the TaskHandle (detach at handle level only).
//!   - Use a supervisor pattern (parent waits indefinitely).
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - added `Scope::spawn_detached(...)` returning a unit
//!     handle that doesnt anchor to a region (would break
//!     "every task owned by one region" invariant),
//!   - added `TaskHandle::detach()` that orphans the task
//!     (would conflate handle-drop semantics with region-
//!     escape; tokio-style API would conflict with
//!     structured concurrency),
//!   - changed Scope::spawn to skip region.add_task on
//!     some opt-in flag (silent escape from region tree),
//!   - removed the all_tasks_done check from
//!     can_region_finalize (would let regions close with
//!     live tasks — orphan pathway),
//!   - introduced a "global detach pool" that holds tasks
//!     outside any region (would violate the region-tree
//!     invariant entirely),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

//! RaptorQ RFC 6330 differential testing scaffold.
//!
//! This crate provides the provenance and fixture-catalog layer for
//! cross-implementation differential testing. It intentionally focuses on the
//! durable metadata path first: which reference implementation was used, which
//! command generated a fixture, and which artifacts belong to each test case.

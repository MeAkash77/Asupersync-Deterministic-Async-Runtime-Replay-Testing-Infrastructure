//! br-asupersync-emg1zb. The pre-existing h1_rfc9112 suite covered chunked

//! rules that gate request-smuggling vectors. This file adds the missing
//! must-pass / must-reject vectors:
//!
//!   - §6.3: Transfer-Encoding > Content-Length precedence
//!   - §9.3.6 + §9.3.7: HEAD / CONNECT response body absence
//!   - §6.2.2: Connection-header token semantics (close / keep-alive)
//!
//! The vectors are protocol-level: the harness parses raw bytes and
//! observes the parser's verdict. Any deviation from the spec verdict is a
//! conformance gap.

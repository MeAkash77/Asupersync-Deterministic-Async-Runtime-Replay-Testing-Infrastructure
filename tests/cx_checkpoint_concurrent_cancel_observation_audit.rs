//! Audit + regression test for `Cx::checkpoint()` observation
//! of CONCURRENT cancel arrivals.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when checkpoint is called and a
//! CONCURRENT cancel arrives mid-call, must the checkpoint
//! observe the cancel and return Err (correct: prompt
//! cancellation) or finish without observing (incorrect:
//! window for missed cancellation)?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   asupersync's checkpoint provides **bounded next-call
//!   observation** of concurrent cancels via a Release-
//!   Acquire pair on `fast_cancel: Arc<AtomicBool>`. The
//!   semantics are nuanced:
//!
//!   1. **Cancel arrives BEFORE fast-path Acquire load**:
//!      fast path observes the cancel, falls through to
//!      slow path, returns Err on the SAME call.
//!   2. **Cancel arrives BETWEEN fast-path read lock + Acquire
//!      load and early Ok return**: a sub-microsecond
//!      window where the fast path returns Ok. The cancel
//!      is published via Release; the NEXT checkpoint's
//!      Acquire load observes it.
//!   3. **Cancel arrives DURING slow path**: serialized by
//!      the write lock on CxInner. The cancel-publishing
//!      thread (request_cancel_with_budget) and the slow-
//!      path checkpoint both acquire the write lock —
//!      whichever lock acquisition order wins determines
//!      observation order, but no cancel is LOST.
//!
//!   The "missed cancellation" framing is technically a
//!   one-checkpoint-cycle delay, NOT a permanent miss. The
//!   Release-Acquire pair guarantees cross-thread visibility
//!   on the next Acquire load. Per asupersync's cooperative-
//!   cancel contract, checkpoints fire frequently enough
//!   (typically every iteration of an async loop) that
//!   one-checkpoint delay is well within the bounded-
//!   latency promise.
//!
//!   The chain:
//!
//!   1. **`fast_cancel: Arc<AtomicBool>`** is the cross-
//!      thread cancel signal (types/task_context.rs:115).
//!      The Arc lets multiple threads share the atomic.
//!
//!   2. **Cancel publisher (request_cancel_with_budget)**:
//!      ```ignore
//!      inner.fast_cancel.store(true, Release);
//!      ```
//!      The Release store synchronizes with any subsequent
//!      Acquire load on the same atomic. ALL prior writes
//!      become visible to the reader.
//!
//!   3. **Cancel reader (checkpoint fast path)** (cx/cx.rs:
//!      1664):
//!      ```ignore
//!      let guard = self.inner.read();
//!      let cancelled = guard.fast_cancel.load(Acquire);
//!      ```
//!      The Acquire load synchronizes with any prior
//!      Release store. If the cancel was published BEFORE
//!      this load (in the happens-before sense), `cancelled`
//!      is true.
//!
//!   4. **Bounded race window**: between the Acquire load
//!      and the early Ok return, the fast path does only:
//!      read budget for exhaustion check (Copy), perform two
//!      Relaxed atomic ops for accounting, and return Ok.
//!      The window is sub-microsecond. A cancel arriving
//!      in this window is observed by the NEXT checkpoint
//!      (not THIS one).
//!
//!   5. **Slow-path write lock serializes concurrent
//!      operations**: when checkpoint enters the slow path,
//!      it acquires `self.inner.write()`. The cancel
//!      publisher also acquires `self.inner.write()` in
//!      request_cancel_with_budget. parking_lot's write
//!      lock is exclusive — only one thread mutates inner
//!      at a time. So during slow-path execution, NO
//!      concurrent publish can interleave; the slow path's
//!      `inner.cancel_requested` read sees a consistent
//!      snapshot.
//!
//!   6. **No instantaneous-observation guarantee**: the
//!      Release-Acquire pair does NOT make checkpoint
//!      observe a cancel SET DURING the fast-path window.
//!      That would require either:
//!        - A blocking primitive (would slow the hot path).
//!        - A polling loop in checkpoint (CPU waste).
//!
//!      asupersync chooses the cooperative model: checkpoints
//!      fire frequently; one-checkpoint delay is acceptable.
//!
//!   7. **Cancel WAKER for parked tasks**: tasks parked on
//!      a Sleep/channel/etc. don't poll checkpoint at all.
//!      For these, the cross-thread cancel propagation goes
//!      through the cancel-aware Waker (CancelLaneWaker) —
//!      see tests/scheduler_cross_thread_cancel_propagation_audit.rs.
//!      The waker triggers a re-poll which then enters
//!      checkpoint. So parked-task observation is bounded
//!      by waker dispatch latency, not by checkpoint
//!      frequency.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. Concurrent cancels are observed by
//! the NEXT checkpoint via the Release-Acquire pair —
//! bounded one-cycle latency, never permanent miss. The
//! operator's "missed cancellation" framing is a category
//! error: missed-this-checkpoint vs missed-forever. The
//! latter doesn't happen.
//!
//! For STRICT same-call observation, callers can:
//!   1. Acquire the inner write lock manually before
//!      checkpoint (would force serialization with the
//!      publisher).
//!   2. Use yield_now() between checkpoints in tight loops
//!      (gives the publisher a chance to grab the lock).
//!   3. Rely on the cancel waker for parked-task wakeup.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - changed fast_cancel from Arc<AtomicBool> to a non-
//!     shared bool (would lose cross-thread visibility
//!     entirely — concurrent cancel observation broken),
//!   - replaced the Acquire load with Relaxed (cross-thread
//!     visibility no longer guaranteed — observation may
//!     be permanent miss, not just one-cycle delay),
//!   - replaced the Release store with Relaxed (publisher
//!     may not see the cancel published; same effect as
//!     above),
//!   - removed the slow-path write-lock serialization
//!     (concurrent publishes during slow path could race
//!     and lose updates),
//!   - introduced a "polling loop" in checkpoint that
//!     spin-waits for cancel observation (CPU waste; would
//!     also block other progress on the worker),
//!   - lost the cancel waker for parked tasks (parked
//!     tasks would never observe cancel — full
//!     missed-cancel pathway),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below or
//!     by behavioral verification.

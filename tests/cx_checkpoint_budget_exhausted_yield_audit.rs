//! Audit + regression test for `Cx::checkpoint()` behavior
//! when budget is exhausted (poll_quota=0 / cost_quota=0 /
//! past deadline).
//!
//! Operator's question: "when budget=0, does checkpoint()
//! yield to scheduler (correct: anti-monopoly) or proceed
//! without yielding (incorrect: allows runaway tasks)?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   `Cx::checkpoint()` correctly **forces a yield** when
//!   budget is exhausted, by returning `Err(Cancelled)` so
//!   the user's `?` propagation surrenders the worker. The
//!   anti-monopoly chain:
//!
//!   1. **`checkpoint_budget_exhaustion` detects exhaustion**
//!      (cx/cx.rs:1952): a single function checks all three
//!      bounds in one pass:
//!      ```ignore
//!      if budget.is_past_deadline(now) { Some((Deadline, ...)) }
//!      if budget.poll_quota == 0 { Some((PollQuota, ...)) }
//!      if matches!(budget.cost_quota, Some(0)) { Some((CostBudget, ...)) }
//!      ```
//!      Returns `Some((CancelReason, exhaustion_kind, ...))`
//!      when any bound is breached.
//!
//!   2. **Slow path publishes self-cancel** (cx/cx.rs:1707-
//!      1717): when the fast path observes exhaustion via
//!      the same function, it falls into the slow path which
//!      under the write lock:
//!      ```ignore
//!      if let Some((reason, _, _)) = &budget_exhaustion {
//!          inner.cancel_requested = true;
//!          inner.fast_cancel.store(true, Release);
//!          if let Some(existing) = &mut inner.cancel_reason {
//!              existing.strengthen(reason);
//!          } else {
//!              inner.cancel_reason = Some(reason.clone());
//!          }
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      The exhaustion is converted into a STRUCTURAL CANCEL
//!      — same protocol as a parent-region cancel, just
//!      with a different `CancelKind` (Deadline / PollQuota /
//!      CostBudget instead of UserCancel / ParentCancelled).
//!
//!   3. **Mask-respecting acknowledgment** (cx/cx.rs:1718):
//!      `if inner.cancel_requested && inner.mask_depth == 0`
//!      gates `cancel_acknowledged = true`. Inside a
//!      Cx::with_mask block, the cancel is OBSERVED but
//!      acknowledgment is DEFERRED until the mask unwinds.
//!
//!   4. **`check_cancel_from_values` returns Err on
//!      observation** (cx/cx.rs:2068-2098): the final return
//!      depends on mask_depth:
//!        - `mask_depth == 0`: `Err(Cancelled)` — the
//!          surface contract forces a yield.
//!        - `mask_depth > 0`: `Ok(())` — but the cancel
//!          state is recorded, so the NEXT checkpoint
//!          AFTER the mask unwinds returns Err.
//!
//!   5. **`?` propagation surrenders the worker**: the user
//!      writes `cx.checkpoint()?;` in their async code. The
//!      Err propagates up the await chain, returning the
//!      future's poll as `Poll::Ready(Outcome::Cancelled(...))`
//!      (or similar). The worker observes the Ready outcome
//!      and dispatches the task as cancel work.
//!
//!   6. **Self-cancel CancelKind reflects exhausted resource**:
//!      the `CancelReason` stamped onto the cx carries
//!      `CancelKind::Deadline`, `CancelKind::PollQuota`, or
//!      `CancelKind::CostBudget` depending on which bound was
//!      hit. Cleanup tasks see the right reason in their
//!      cancel-cause chain — debugging fidelity preserved.
//!
//!   7. **Anti-monopoly contract is hard, not advisory**:
//!      a runaway task that ignores the Err from checkpoint
//!      (e.g., `let _ = cx.checkpoint();`) does NOT escape
//!      the bound. The slow path ALSO sets the state on
//!      CxInner, so the next checkpoint observes the prior
//!      cancel. The cooperative-scheduling general property
//!      still applies: the task can only run as long as it
//!      cooperatively returns Pending or Ready. If it ignores
//!      checkpoint Err and continues, that's the user's bug,
//!      not a runtime defect.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. checkpoint() with exhausted budget
//! forces a yield via Err(Cancelled) → ?-propagation. The
//! mechanism is the same as parent-region cancel: cancel
//! state on CxInner + Acquire-Release atomic for cross-
//! thread visibility + ?-propagation surrenders the worker.
//!
//! The mask-deferred case (cancel_requested=true, mask_depth>0)
//! is correct: cancel is OBSERVED but ack DEFERRED. The
//! next checkpoint after mask unwind catches it.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - removed the budget_exhaustion → cancel-state publish
//!     in the slow path (cx.rs:1707-1717) (would let
//!     subsequent checkpoints observe a stale fast_cancel
//!     state — the exhaustion would be detected once but
//!     not converted into a structural cancel),
//!   - changed checkpoint to return Ok on exhaustion when
//!     mask_depth == 0 (would let runaway tasks proceed
//!     past their budget — exactly the operator's "incorrect"
//!     answer),
//!   - removed the CancelKind::Deadline / PollQuota /
//!     CostBudget stamping (would lose the exhausted-resource
//!     attribution — debugging cancel reasons becomes blind),
//!   - changed the mask gate so acknowledgment fires INSIDE
//!     the mask (would break the mask protocol — masked code
//!     gets cancelled mid-critical-section),
//!   - made the slow-path budget_exhaustion check skip the
//!     fast_cancel.store(Release) (would lose cross-thread
//!     visibility for subsequent checkpoint calls),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

//! Audit + regression test for `Scope::spawn_local` vs
//! `Scope::spawn` distinction.
//!
//! Operator's question: "if spawn_local is API-exposed,
//! must it require !Send futures (correct: thread-pinned)
//! and reject Send-only futures clearly. Verify trait
//! bounds."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   asupersync's spawn_local **accepts BOTH `Send` and
//!   `!Send` futures** (no `Send` bound on `F` or `Fut`),
//!   and the thread-pinning is enforced by ROUTING (not by
//!   trait-level rejection of Send futures). This is the
//!   correct design for stable Rust. The operator's framing
//!   ("must reject Send-only futures") would be HARMFUL —
//!   here's why:
//!
//!   1. **Send is a CAPABILITY, not a constraint**. A Send
//!      future implements every interface a !Send future
//!      does, plus the additional capability of being
//!      transferred between threads. Accepting a Send future
//!      into spawn_local is sound — it just means the future
//!      stays on the local worker (the same outcome as a
//!      !Send future, by routing). Rejecting Send would
//!      force users to wrap with a !Send marker (e.g., a
//!      PhantomData<*const ()> field) just to opt into
//!      local-only scheduling.
//!
//!   2. **Stable Rust has NO negative trait bounds**.
//!      Writing `F: !Send` requires the unstable `auto_traits`
//!      / `negative_impls` features. Even on nightly, the
//!      negative-bound semantics are not yet decided. A
//!      regression that added `F: !Send` would either fail
//!      to compile under stable rustc or require a project-
//!      wide nightly opt-in.
//!
//!   3. **Routing enforces the distinction** (cx/scope.rs:
//!      706-721): spawn_local builds a `LocalStoredTask`
//!      (NOT `StoredTask`), stores it via
//!      `crate::runtime::local::store_local_task` (thread-
//!      local storage), pins the task to the current worker
//!      via `record.pin_to_worker(worker_id)` (or
//!      `record.mark_local()`), and schedules via
//!      `schedule_local_task` which lands on the worker's
//!      NON-STEALABLE local scheduler. A Send future passed
//!      into spawn_local follows the same routing — it's
//!      pinned regardless of its Send-ability.
//!
//!   4. **`spawn` requires Send for soundness, not
//!      preference**: when spawn (not spawn_local) is used,
//!      the `Fut: Send` bound is NECESSARY because the
//!      future is wrapped in a `StoredTask` (with `+ Send`
//!      in the trait object) that may be moved between
//!      worker threads via work-stealing. Without `Send`,
//!      stealing a !Send future would be undefined behavior.
//!      The asymmetry is correct: spawn requires Send;
//!      spawn_local doesn't.
//!
//!   5. **The two paths are observably different**:
//!      - `spawn` → `StoredTask` (Send) → global stealable
//!        queue OR local stealable LocalQueue.
//!      - `spawn_local` → `LocalStoredTask` (no Send) →
//!        local non-stealable `local_ready` queue.
//!        The user's choice of which to call IS the choice of
//!        scheduling discipline. Both type-checked, both
//!        enforced — by the type bound on `spawn` and by the
//!        routing target on `spawn_local`.
//!
//!   6. **Send users gain by choosing spawn_local
//!      explicitly**: a Send future passed to spawn_local
//!      gets thread affinity (no work-stealing migration).
//!      This is sometimes desired for cache locality,
//!      avoiding cross-CPU shared-state ping-pong, or for
//!      tasks that interact with thread-local state. A
//!      regression that rejected Send futures would force
//!      these users into ergonomic workarounds.
//!
//!   7. **Output bound IS Send for both** (Fut::Output:
//!      Send + 'static): the parent's JoinHandle may be
//!      awaited from any thread, so the output must cross
//!      thread boundaries. Asymmetric on F/Fut, symmetric on
//!      Output.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND BY DESIGN**. spawn_local accepts both
//! Send and !Send by intent. The thread-pinning distinction
//! is enforced by routing (LocalStoredTask + thread-local
//! storage + non-stealable scheduler), not by trait-level
//! Send-rejection. Per the operator's strict framing, this
//! is technically a "no" — but the correct interpretation
//! is that the operator's framing contains a category
//! error: stable Rust has no negative trait bounds, and
//! even if it did, rejecting Send futures from spawn_local
//! would be harmful.
//!
//! What the audit DOES pin:
//!   - spawn requires Send on F/Fut (already pinned in
//!     tests/scheduler_spawn_send_bounds_compile_time_audit.rs).
//!   - spawn_local does NOT require Send (intentional
//!     escape hatch).
//!   - spawn_local routes through LocalStoredTask, NOT
//:     StoredTask.
//!   - spawn_local schedules via schedule_local_task, NOT
//!     schedule (the stealable path).
//!   - spawn_local pins the task record to the current
//!     worker via pin_to_worker / mark_local.
//!   - LocalStoredTask trait object drops the Send bound;
//!     StoredTask carries it.
//!   - The non-stealable local_ready queue is the routing
//!     target; the stealable LocalQueue is NOT.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - added `F: !Send` or similar negative bound on
//!     spawn_local (would require nightly + would harm
//!     legitimate Send-with-affinity users),
//!   - made spawn_local route through StoredTask + the
//!     stealable queue (would silently allow !Send futures
//!     to be stolen — undefined behavior pathway),
//!   - removed the pin_to_worker / mark_local call on the
//!     task record (would lose the routing-time pinning
//!     guard; cancel propagation may try to steal the
//!     local task across workers),
//!   - removed `schedule_local_task`'s non-stealable
//!     property (would lose the runtime-time guard),
//!   - made spawn require !Send (would break the existing
//!     work-stealing path for the common case of Send
//!     futures),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

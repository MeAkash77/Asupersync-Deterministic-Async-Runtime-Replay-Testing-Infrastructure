//! Audit + regression test for cancel-propagation chain when a
//! parent region is dropped / closed while a child task is sitting
//! in the deadline-monotone (timed) lane.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when a task's parent region is dropped
//! while task is in deadline-monotone lane, does the task get
//! observable cancellation (correct: structured concurrency) OR
//! continue executing orphaned (incorrect: orphan task)? Per
//! AGENTS.md 'no orphan tasks'."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   The cancel-propagation chain has FIVE links, all in place:
//!
//!   1. **Region close triggers subtree walk**
//!      (`src/runtime/state.rs` `cancel_region_subtree` family,
//!      around line 2620). Iterates regions in the dropped
//!      subtree, calling `region.begin_close(Some(reason))` on
//!      each. The region transitions to Closing state.
//!
//!   2. **Each task in each closing region gets
//!      `request_cancel_with_budget`** (state.rs:2682). This
//!      flips `cancel_requested = true` on the task's CxInner
//!      AND `fast_cancel.store(true, Release)` on the atomic
//!      so a concurrently-running task observes the flag on its
//!      next `cx.checkpoint()` call.
//!
//!   3. **The caller invokes
//!      `scheduler.move_to_cancel_lane(task_id, priority)`** for
//!      every task that was newly cancelled. This is the
//!      O(log N) lazy-promote function in
//!      `src/runtime/scheduler/priority.rs` (the
//!      br-asupersync-cancel-promote-logn fix from earlier
//!      today). The function pushes a new entry into
//!      `cancel_lane` without scanning timed_lane / ready_lane;
//!      the original entry in the source lane becomes a
//!      TOMBSTONE.
//!
//!   4. **The dispatcher's `next_task` pops cancel_lane FIRST**
//!      in default mode (three_lane.rs:3409 "Default / drain:
//!      cancel > timed."). The new cancel-lane entry pops
//!      before any timed work. The stale timed-lane entry is
//!      LAZY-SKIPPED on its eventual pop because `pop()` gates
//!      every dispatch on `self.scheduled.remove(entry.task)`,
//!      and the scheduled set was already cleared when the
//!      cancel-lane entry was dispatched.
//!
//!   5. **Inside the task, `cx.checkpoint()` observes the
//!      latched `fast_cancel` flag** (cx.rs:1664-1672 fast-path
//!      check). The check returns `Err(...)` so the task yields
//!      via `?` propagation, control returns to the scheduler,
//!      and the task finalizes through the normal cancellation
//!      drain. Per AGENTS.md "cancellation is a protocol:
//!      request → drain → finalize (idempotent)".
//!
//!   The task does NOT continue executing orphaned because:
//!   - `move_to_cancel_lane` puts the task in the highest-
//!     priority lane regardless of where it was previously.
//!   - Cancel-lane priority guarantees dispatch within
//!     bounded time (cancel_streak fairness limit).
//!   - Once dispatched, `cx.checkpoint()` observes the cancel
//!     and returns Err, terminating the task body.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. The "no orphan tasks" invariant from
//! AGENTS.md is upheld for tasks in the timed lane when their
//! parent region is dropped. Three converging mechanisms enforce
//! this: cancel propagation flips the per-task flag,
//! lazy-promote re-routes the task to the cancel lane, and the
//! cooperative checkpoint protocol surfaces the cancel to the
//! task body.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - skipped `move_to_cancel_lane` for tasks already in
//!     timed_lane (would let them sit at their original
//!     deadline-driven priority — orphan if the deadline is
//!     far in the future),
//!   - dropped the `request_cancel_with_budget` call from the
//!     region-cancel propagation (would never set
//!     cancel_requested, leaving the task running normally),
//!   - reverted `move_to_cancel_lane` to eager-remove (would
//!     keep correctness but reintroduce O(N) latency from the
//!     earlier audit),
//!   - removed the `scheduled.remove` gate from the dispatcher's
//!     pop (would surface the timed-lane tombstone as a
//!     duplicate dispatch),
//!   - removed the `fast_cancel.store(true, Release)` from
//!     request_cancel_with_budget (would let the task's
//!     subsequent checkpoint miss the cancel),
//!     would all be caught here.

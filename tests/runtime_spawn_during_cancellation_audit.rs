//! Audit + regression test for spawn-during-cancellation
//! correctness in `src/runtime/state.rs` and the region admission
//! gate.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when task A is being cancelled and during
//! its drop-handler it spawns task B, does B observe parent A as
//! cancelled (correct: structured) or run independently (orphan)?
//! Per AGENTS.md."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   When task A is being cancelled, A's region transitions to
//!   Closing state (via `region.begin_close(reason)`). The
//!   region's admission gate (`can_spawn() / can_accept_work()`)
//!   returns false for any state other than Open. So a user
//!   call to `state.create_task(region, ...)` from A's drop-
//!   handler is REJECTED with a typed
//!   `SpawnError::RegionClosed(region)` error — NOT silently
//!   created as an orphan.
//!
//!   Audit chain:
//!
//!   1. **`RegionState::can_spawn`** (`src/record/region.rs:127`)
//!      returns `matches!(self, Self::Open)`. Only Open regions
//!      accept new work. Closing / Draining / Finalizing /
//!      Closed all reject.
//!
//!   2. **`RegionRecord::add_task`** is the admission gate. When
//!      called in non-Open state, it returns
//!      `AdmissionError::Closed`.
//!
//!   3. **`RuntimeState::create_task`** (state.rs:1619) calls
//!      `region_record.add_task(task_id)`. On
//!      `AdmissionError::Closed`, it rolls back the partial task
//!      creation (`remove_task`) AND returns
//!      `SpawnError::RegionClosed(region)` (state.rs:1533).
//!
//!   4. **The user-facing spawn path** propagates this error to
//!      the caller via the standard `Result<TaskId, SpawnError>`
//!      return type. A drop-handler spawn that ignored the Err
//!      would be the user's bug — but the FRAMEWORK refuses to
//!      create the orphan.
//!
//!   5. **The legitimate during-cancel spawn path** is
//!      `RuntimeState::spawn_finalizer_task` (state.rs:3000-3060)
//!      which uses `create_task_infrastructure(region_id, budget,
//!      true)` where `true` is `is_cleanup`. This routes through
//!      `add_cleanup_task` instead of `add_task`. Cleanup tasks
//!      ARE allowed in Finalizing state — that's the whole point
//!      of finalizers. But cleanup admission is NOT exposed as a
//!      user-spawn API; it's restricted to the finalizer
//!      registry.
//!
//!   In-crate test `cancel_request_should_prevent_new_spawns`
//!   (state.rs:7911) explicitly pins this: after
//!   `state.cancel_request(region, ...)`,
//!   `region_state.can_spawn()` returns false AND
//!   `state.create_task(region, ...)` returns
//!   `Err(SpawnError::RegionClosed(_))`.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. The "no orphan tasks" invariant from
//! AGENTS.md is upheld for spawns during cancellation. The
//! framework rejects user spawns with a typed error rather
//! than creating an orphan; the controlled finalizer-spawn path
//! is the only during-cancel admission and it's bound to the
//! same closing region (NOT orphaned).
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - changed `RegionState::can_spawn` to accept Closing /
//!     Draining (would let drop-handler spawns silently
//!     orphan into a closing region — they'd still be tracked
//!     but their parent has logically committed to close),
//!   - changed `add_task` admission to silently succeed in
//!     non-Open states (would create the orphan — task in a
//!     closed region),
//!   - changed the SpawnError mapping in create_task to swallow
//!     the AdmissionError::Closed (would let create_task
//!     return Ok with a half-created task — leak risk),
//!   - opened the cleanup-spawn path to user code without
//!     restriction (would let any code masquerade as a
//!     finalizer and spawn into closed regions),
//!   - removed the existing
//!     cancel_request_should_prevent_new_spawns in-crate
//!     test (would let regressions slip through CI),
//!     would all be caught here.

//! Audit + regression test for `src/messaging/redis.rs` Redis
//! cluster MOVED/ASK redirect handling.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when server replies 'MOVED 12345
//! host:port', does our client (a) follow the redirect once
//! and retry on new node, or (b) follow redirects in a loop
//! until success? Per Redis cluster spec, follow once + cache
//! slot mapping."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   (a) **The implementation is the production-correct
//!       middle ground**: a BOUNDED loop, capped at
//!       `MAX_REDIRECTS = 5` hops (otel.rs:1887,
//!       br-asupersync-hzgugy). Strict "follow once" is
//!       unrealistic — real cluster topologies during a
//!       resharding event can legitimately produce 2-3
//!       sequential MOVED responses as the client's stale
//!       slot map catches up. Production clients (jedis,
//!       redis-py, redis-rs) all use a bounded chain in the
//!       5-16 hop range.
//!
//!   (b) **MOVED handling** (redis.rs:2249-2253):
//!       - Updates `self.slot_map.lock().insert(slot, addr)`
//!         BEFORE issuing the retry. Subsequent commands for
//!         keys hashing into that slot will go directly to
//!         the new owner without round-tripping through the
//!         old node.
//!       - Opens a new connection to the redirect target,
//!         re-executes the command, and on success returns
//!         immediately.
//!
//!   (c) **ASK handling** (redis.rs:2254-2266) per Redis
//!       cluster spec:
//!       - Does NOT update the slot map (the migration is
//!         transient — the slot is in the middle of being
//!         moved, ownership hasn't fully transferred).
//!       - Prepends an `ASKING` command to grant one-shot
//!         permission for the next command on the new node.
//!       - Verifies the ASKING response is `OK` before
//!         issuing the actual command (prevents protocol
//!         confusion if the server returns something
//!         unexpected).
//!
//!   (d) **Adversarial-loop bound** (redis.rs:2236-2241):
//!       `redirects: u8` with `saturating_add(1)` and an
//!       `if redirects > MAX_REDIRECTS` early-return guard.
//!       After exhaustion, the function returns
//!       `RedisError::Protocol("...exceeded maximum of 5
//!       hops...")`. This bounds the worst case for a
//!       byzantine cluster that tries to trap a client in a
//!       redirect cycle.
//!
//!   (e) **Connection hygiene** (redis.rs:2270): the redirect
//!       connection is shut down via `shutdown_transport()`
//!       between hops — a redirect target is treated as a
//!       transient connection, not pooled. The first
//!       successful path on the redirect target writes back
//!       to the slot map (MOVED branch); subsequent commands
//!       use the regular pooled connection to the now-cached
//!       owner.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. The behavior is correct per Redis
//! cluster spec: cache slot mapping on MOVED, prepend ASKING
//! on ASK, bound the chain to prevent adversarial loops. The
//! operator's strict "follow once" interpretation is too
//! conservative for real-world cluster resharding scenarios;
//! the bounded-loop pattern is the production norm.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - removed the MAX_REDIRECTS cap (would let an
//!     adversarial cluster trap the client forever),
//!   - changed MAX_REDIRECTS to 1 (would break legitimate
//!     mid-resharding scenarios — clients would observe
//!     spurious "exceeded max hops" errors during normal
//!     cluster maintenance),
//!   - dropped the slot_map.insert on MOVED (would defeat
//!     the caching, forcing every key into a redirect),
//!   - added slot_map.insert on ASK (would corrupt the slot
//!     map with a transient migration target),
//!   - failed to prepend ASKING on the ASK retry (would
//!     produce protocol errors against the migration
//!     target),
//!   - reused the pooled connection for the redirect target
//!     (mismatched handshake state — the target may not be
//!     authenticated against the same DB),
//!     would all be caught here.

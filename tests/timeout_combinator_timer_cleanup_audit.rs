//! Audit + regression test for timeout combinator timer
//! cleanup when the inner future completes before the
//! deadline.
//!
//! Operator's question: "Cx::with_timeout(d, fut) shorthand:
//! when fut completes before deadline d, does the timeout
//! future correctly resolve to Ok (correct) and cancel the
//! timer? Verify the timer is properly cancelled (not
//! leaked)."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   asupersync does NOT have a literal `Cx::with_timeout(d,
//!   fut)` method. The timeout pattern is composed from
//!   primitives:
//!     - `Sleep::after(now, duration)` — the deadline future.
//!     - `Scope::race(cx, fut, sleep_fut)` — races the user's
//!       fut against the deadline; drops the loser.
//!     - `combinator::timeout::Timeout<T>` + `TimedResult<T,
//!       E>` — structured types for timeout handling.
//!
//!   When the inner fut completes BEFORE the deadline:
//!     1. race observes the inner fut Ready.
//!     2. race drops the Sleep loser.
//!     3. Sleep::Drop fires (sleep.rs:693-723) — cancels the
//!        registered TimerHandle via `driver.cancel(&handle)`.
//!     4. Trace event `timer_cancelled` fires for
//!        observability.
//!
//!   Timer cancellation paths (4 distinct):
//!
//!   1. **`Sleep::Drop`** (sleep.rs:693-723): when the Sleep
//!      future is dropped (e.g., race drops the loser),
//!      Drop takes the timer_handle + timer_driver out of
//!      the state and calls `driver.cancel(&handle)`. The
//!      `let _ =` ignores the cancel result (the timer may
//!      have already fired — both branches are safe).
//!
//!   2. **`Sleep::poll` Ready branch** (sleep.rs:502-518):
//!      when poll_with_time returns Ready, the outer poll
//!      fn cancels the timer immediately via the same
//!      `driver.cancel(&handle)` call. This handles the
//!      case where the deadline arrives BEFORE the future
//!      is dropped (e.g., the timer fires and the next
//:      poll completes Ready).
//!
//!   3. **`Sleep::reset_after`** (sleep.rs:398-431): when
//!      the Sleep is reset to a new deadline, the OLD
//!      timer is cancelled before the new one is
//!      registered. Prevents stale-timer accumulation
//!      under repeated reset.
//!
//!   4. **`Sleep::reset`** (sleep.rs:380-391, similar
//!      pattern at sleep.rs:560 for driver migration):
//:      same cancel-on-replace pattern.
//!
//!   Each cancel path also emits a `TraceEvent::timer_cancelled`
//!   trace event so operators can see when timers are
//!   cleaned up — debugging timer-leak suspicions has
//!   structured observability.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. Timer cleanup is enforced in 4
//! distinct paths. The Sleep::Drop path is the structural
//! guarantee for the operator's scenario (fut completes
//! first, race drops the Sleep loser, Drop cancels the
//! timer). The trace events provide observability for
//! operators to audit timer lifecycle.
//!
//! No bead filed. The cleanup is structurally enforced.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - removed the Sleep Drop impl (would leak timer
//!     handles indefinitely — the timer driver fires
//!     callbacks for tasks that no longer exist, wasting
//:     CPU and memory),
//!   - removed the Ready-branch driver.cancel call (would
//!     leak the just-fired timer's bookkeeping until the
//!     Sleep itself is dropped — minor leak, but
//!     measurable),
//!   - removed the timer_cancelled trace event (lost
//!     observability — operators cant audit the timer
//!     lifecycle),
//!   - changed the Drop impl to NOT take the timer_handle
//!     out of state (would leave a dangling reference if
//!     the Sleep is reused — UB pathway),
//!   - added a reference cycle between Sleep and the timer
//!     driver (would prevent Drop from firing — silent
//!     leak),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

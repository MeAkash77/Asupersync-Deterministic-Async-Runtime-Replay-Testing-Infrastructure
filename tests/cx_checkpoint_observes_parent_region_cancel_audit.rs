//! Audit + regression test for `Cx::checkpoint()` cancel
//! observation when the parent region is being cancelled.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when checkpoint() is called and parent
//! region is being cancelled, does it return Cancelled error
//! (correct) or proceed (incorrect)?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   This is the UNION of two prior audits:
//!     - tests/scheduler_cooperative_budget_yield_audit.rs:
//!       pins the checkpoint observation path
//!       (fast_cancel.load(Acquire) → Err return).
//!     - tests/scheduler_region_drop_propagates_cancel_to_timed_lane_audit.rs:
//!       pins the propagation chain (region close →
//!       request_cancel_with_budget → fast_cancel.store(true,
//!       Release)).
//!
//!   Cross-referenced summary of the chain (region cancel →
//!   task observation):
//!
//!   1. **Parent region cancel** triggers `state.cancel_request(
//!      region, &reason, _)` (state.rs cancel_region_subtree).
//!      The subtree walk transitions each region in the
//!      affected subtree to Closing via `region.begin_close(
//!      Some(reason))`.
//!
//!   2. **Per-task cancel propagation** (state.rs:2682): for
//!      every task in every closing region,
//!      `task.request_cancel_with_budget(reason, budget)` is
//!      called. This sets:
//!        - `inner.cancel_requested = true`
//!        - `inner.fast_cancel.store(true, Release)`
//!        - `inner.cancel_reason = Some(reason)` (or
//!          strengthened against existing reason).
//!
//!   3. **`Cx::checkpoint()` fast path** (cx.rs:1664-1672)
//!      reads `guard.fast_cancel.load(Ordering::Acquire)`. The
//!      Release-on-store / Acquire-on-load pair guarantees
//!      cross-thread visibility of the cancel flag.
//!
//!   4. **Slow-path resolution** (cx.rs:1697-1733): when
//!      `fast_cancel == true`, checkpoint enters the slow
//!      path under the write lock, re-runs
//!      `checkpoint_budget_exhaustion`, sets
//!      `cancel_acknowledged` if mask_depth==0, and delegates
//!      to `check_cancel_from_values` for the Err return.
//!
//!   5. **Error propagation via `?`**: the user calls
//!      `cx.checkpoint()?` in their async code; the Err
//!      propagates up the await chain, returning control to
//!      the scheduler. The task is then dispatched as cancel
//!      work and finalizes through the normal cancellation
//!      drain.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. checkpoint() returns Cancelled error
//! when the parent region is being cancelled. The
//! Release-Acquire pair on `fast_cancel` provides the cross-
//! thread visibility; the cooperative-yield contract surfaces
//! the cancel via `?` propagation.
//!
//! Mask interaction: per AGENTS.md "cancellation is a
//! protocol", a mask defers cancel acknowledgment. Inside a
//! `Cx::with_mask` block, checkpoint observes
//! cancel_requested=true but does NOT set
//! cancel_acknowledged=true (that's gated on
//! `mask_depth == 0`). The Err is still returned to the
//! caller though — the mask defers the FINALIZATION, not the
//! observation.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - dropped the fast_cancel.load(Acquire) on checkpoint's
//!     fast path (would let cancellation requests miss the
//!     observation),
//!   - dropped the fast_cancel.store(true, Release) in
//!     request_cancel_with_budget (would break the visibility
//!     pair — checkpoint may not observe a concurrently-set
//!     flag),
//!   - changed checkpoint to return Ok when cancel_requested
//!     is true (would silently swallow cancellation),
//!   - removed the mask_depth gate from cancel_acknowledged
//!     (would prematurely acknowledge cancellation inside a
//!     mask, breaking the protocol),
//!     would all be caught here AND by the two prior audits.
//!
//! This file's pins are deliberately MINIMAL — they cross-
//! reference the prior audit files for the detailed chain.
//! The minimal set guards the SPECIFIC interaction: parent-
//! region-cancel → checkpoint Err return.

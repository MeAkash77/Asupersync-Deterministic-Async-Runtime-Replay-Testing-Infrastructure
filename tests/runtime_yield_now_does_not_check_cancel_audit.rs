//! Audit + regression test for `yield_now()` interaction
//! with pending cancel.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when yield_now is called and the
//! cancel-bit is already set, must yield_now return
//! Err(Cancelled) (correct: fail-fast) instead of yielding."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   `yield_now()` is a **cancel-ignorant** primitive by
//!   design. Its return type is `Poll<()>`, NOT
//!   `Poll<Result<(), Error>>`. It cannot return
//!   `Err(Cancelled)` because errors are not in its type
//!   signature. This is the **intentional asupersync API
//!   split**:
//!
//!   - **`Cx::checkpoint() -> Result<(), Error>`** — the
//!     cancel-observation primitive. Returns Err on
//!     cancel/budget-exhaustion. Same-call fail-fast.
//!   - **`yield_now() -> impl Future<Output = ()>`** — the
//:     pure scheduler-yield primitive. Returns nothing.
//!     Always yields once and completes.
//!
//!   The operator's "must return Err(Cancelled)" framing
//!   maps onto a NON-EXISTENT API surface — yield_now's
//!   `()` Output cannot carry an error variant. The
//!   structurally correct way to compose fail-fast cancel
//!   observation with a yield is:
//!
//!   ```ignore
//!   loop {
//!       cx.checkpoint()?;       // fail-fast on cancel
//!       yield_now().await;      // pure yield
//!       // ...do work...
//!   }
//!   ```
//!
//!   This separation is deliberate:
//!
//!   1. **`yield_now` doesnt take `&Cx`** — it's a global
//!      primitive (cooperative-yield doesnt need
//!      capability/cancel context).
//!
//!   2. **`yield_now` can be called from any future** — even
//!      ones that dont have a Cx in scope (e.g., low-level
//!      I/O futures, raw Tokio-compat shims). Coupling it
//!      to Cx would force every caller to thread the
//!      capability context through.
//!
//!   3. **`Cx::checkpoint`** is the documented cancel-
//!      observation site (see prior audits:
//!      cx_checkpoint_cancel_fail_fast_audit.rs,
//!      cx_checkpoint_concurrent_cancel_observation_audit.rs).
//!      Adding cancel observation to yield_now would
//!      duplicate the contract.
//!
//!   4. **Cancel propagation works regardless**: if a task
//!      yields via yield_now while cancel is pending, the
//!      task is re-scheduled (the wake_by_ref re-injects
//!      it). On the NEXT poll, the task's NEXT cx.checkpoint
//!      observes the cancel and returns Err. So cancel is
//!      ALWAYS observed at most one yield-cycle late — and
//!      the user controls when checkpoint fires.
//!
//!   The chain:
//!
//!   1. **`YieldNow.poll`** (runtime/yield_now.rs:20):
//!      ```ignore
//!      fn poll(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<()> {
//!          assert!(!self.completed, "yield_now future polled after completion");
//!          if self.yielded {
//!              self.completed = true;
//!              Poll::Ready(())
//!          } else {
//!              self.yielded = true;
//!              cx.waker().wake_by_ref();
//!              Poll::Pending
//!          }
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      No fast_cancel access. No Cx access. No Result
//!      return. Pure two-poll yield.
//!
//!   2. **`yield_now() -> YieldNow`** signature: takes no
//!      arguments, returns a Future<Output = ()>. The Cx
//!      is not in scope here.
//!
//!   3. **No fast_cancel reference** in
//!      `src/runtime/yield_now.rs`: a grep confirms zero
//!      references to fast_cancel, cancel_requested, or
//!      Cx — yield_now is structurally cancel-ignorant.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND BY DESIGN**. The operator's "must
//: return Err(Cancelled)" framing maps onto a NON-EXISTENT
//! API surface — yield_now's Output is `()`, not Result.
//! This is intentional — the asupersync API splits cancel
//! observation (`Cx::checkpoint()?`) from yield
//! (`yield_now().await`). Composing them is the user's
//! responsibility.
//!
//! No bead filed for the fail-fast variant. The two-
//! primitive design is documented; users have a clear
//! pattern (`cx.checkpoint()?; yield_now().await;`).
//!
//! If the operator wants a combined `cx.yield_checkpoint()`
//! method that does both, that's a feature bead, NOT a
//! defect bead. The CURRENT API is correct per its
//! documented contract.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - changed yield_now to take `&Cx` (would couple yield
//!     to capability context — caller now needs Cx in
//!     scope, breaking yield_now from non-Cx contexts),
//!   - changed yield_now's Output from `()` to
//!     `Result<(), Error>` (breaks every existing caller's
//!     `.await` ergonomics — `yield_now().await?` instead
//!     of `yield_now().await`),
//!   - added a fast_cancel.load inside YieldNow::poll
//!     (would silently do cancel observation in a primitive
//!     that doesnt return errors — silent swallow if the
//!     user doesnt also call checkpoint),
//!   - removed yield_now entirely (would lose the pure-
//!     yield primitive — apps would have to compose
//!     ad-hoc Pending+wake patterns),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

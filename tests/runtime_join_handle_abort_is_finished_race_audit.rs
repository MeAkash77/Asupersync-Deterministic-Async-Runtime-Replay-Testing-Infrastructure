//! Audit + regression test for `TaskHandle::abort` /
//! `TaskHandle::is_finished` race semantics.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when abort() is called and
//! immediately is_finished() is checked, what's the
//! expected return? Per asupersync spec, is_finished
//! returns true once cancellation has been observed by
//! the task (could be later)."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   `TaskHandle::abort()` is a CANCEL REQUEST, not an
//:   instantaneous task-termination. Right after abort(),
//!   the task hasn't yet observed the cancel via its next
//!   checkpoint, so `is_finished()` returns **false**.
//!   Eventually (after the task's next checkpoint observes
//!   the published fast_cancel, propagates Err, and the
//!   wrapping future sends `Outcome::Cancelled` through
//!   the result channel), `is_finished()` flips to **true**.
//!
//!   This matches the operator's spec: "is_finished returns
//!   true once cancellation has been observed by the task
//!   (could be later)."
//!
//!   The chain:
//!
//!   1. **`abort()` publishes cancel signal**
//!      (runtime/task_handle.rs:213-240):
//!      ```ignore
//!      pub fn abort(&self) {
//!          self.abort_with_reason(CancelReason::user("abort"));
//!      }
//!      pub fn abort_with_reason(&self, reason: CancelReason) {
//!          if let Some(inner) = self.inner.upgrade() {
//!              let cancel_waker = {
//!                  let mut lock = inner.write();
//!                  lock.cancel_requested = true;
//!                  lock.fast_cancel.store(true, Release);
//!                  ...
//!              };
//!              if let Some(waker) = cancel_waker {
//!                  waker.wake_by_ref();
//!              }
//!          }
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      Sets cancel_requested + fast_cancel + cancel_reason
//!      and wakes the cancel-waker. The task is now
//!      scheduled to run on the cancel lane. Its next poll
//!      observes the cancel via checkpoint.
//!
//!   2. **`is_finished()` returns based on result-channel
//!      state** (runtime/task_handle.rs:108-110):
//!      ```ignore
//!      pub fn is_finished(&self) -> bool {
//!          self.terminal_consumed
//!              || self.receiver.is_ready()
//!              || self.receiver.is_closed()
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      Three conditions, ANY of which signals
//!      task-finished:
//!      a. `terminal_consumed` — the handle already took
//!      the result via join().await.
//!      b. `receiver.is_ready()` — the wrapping future
//!      sent the outcome through the channel; the result is
//!      sitting there waiting.
//!      c. `receiver.is_closed()` — the sender has been
//!      dropped (the task's wrapping future completed and
//!      the result_tx went out of scope).
//!
//!   3. **Right after abort()**: terminal_consumed = false
//!      (nothing has consumed yet), receiver.is_ready() =
//!      false (the wrapping future hasn't sent yet), and
//!      receiver.is_closed() = false (the sender is still
//!      alive). So is_finished() returns **false**.
//!
//!   4. **Eventually** (after the task's next checkpoint
//!      observes the cancel, ?-propagates the Err, and the
//!      wrapping fn sends Outcome::Cancelled through the
//!      result_tx): receiver.is_ready() becomes true, and
//!      is_finished() returns **true**. The "could be
//!      later" clause is bounded by the task's next
//!      checkpoint frequency.
//!
//!   5. **For PARKED tasks** (sleeping on Sleep / channel
//!      / etc.), the cancel-waker wake propagates the
//!      cancel via CancelLaneWaker (per
//!      tests/scheduler_cross_thread_cancel_propagation_audit.rs).
//!      The task wakes, polls, observes cancel via
//!      checkpoint, and eventually sends through result_tx.
//!      is_finished() flips after one waker-dispatch cycle.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. is_finished() returns false right
//! after abort() — the task hasn't yet observed the cancel.
//! Eventually flips to true after the task's wrapping
//! future sends the cancel outcome. The "could be later"
//! is bounded by the task's next checkpoint frequency.
//!
//! No bead filed. The async semantics is documented and
//! the structural mechanism (cancel publish vs result-
//! channel state) is two-stage by design.
//!
//! Note on alternative semantics: a "synchronous abort"
//! that flipped is_finished() immediately would require
//! either (a) blocking abort() until the task quiesces
//! (would block the calling thread arbitrarily — bad), or
//! (b) lying — claim is_finished even though the task is
//! still running (would let users access state thats not
//! actually settled). asupersync chooses the honest
//! "cancel-request semantics".
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - changed abort() to BLOCK until the task quiesces
//!     (would deadlock if abort is called from inside the
//!     same runtime — async-cancel hazard),
//!   - changed is_finished() to return true immediately
//!     after abort() regardless of result-channel state
//!     (would lie to users — they'd try to take a result
//!     thats not yet sent),
//!   - removed the receiver.is_ready() check from
//!     is_finished (would never see the result-arrived
//!     state — perpetual false),
//!   - removed the receiver.is_closed() check (would miss
//!     the sender-dropped case — perpetual false even after
//!     task completion),
//!   - changed abort() to NOT wake the cancel_waker (parked
//!     tasks never observe cancel — is_finished stuck
//!     false forever),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

//! Audit + regression test for `TaskHandle` and `JoinFuture`
//! drop lifecycle.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when a JoinHandle is dropped
//! without await, does the spawned task get aborted
//! (abort_on_drop semantics, like tokio) or detached
//! (continue running, asupersync default)? Per asupersync
//! structured concurrency, region-bound tasks should abort
//! on region drop."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   asupersync has **three distinct drop scopes** with
//!   **three different behaviors** — each appropriate for
//!   its layer:
//!
//!   1. **`TaskHandle` drop alone — DETACHED** (task continues
//!      running). TaskHandle has NO Drop impl. Dropping the
//!      handle without joining lets the spawned task keep
//!      running until completion. This matches asupersyncs
//!      documented "spawn-then-detach" pattern for fire-
//:      and-forget tasks.
//!
//!   2. **`JoinFuture` drop mid-await — ABORTS** (cancel-safe).
//!      JoinFuture (the future returned by
//!      `handle.join(cx)`) DOES have Drop that aborts the
//!      task. This makes `handle.join(cx).await` cancel-
//!      safe — if the await is interrupted (e.g., by a
//!      timeout or race), the spawned task is aborted.
//:      Documented in TaskHandle::join's docstring:
//:      "If this method is cancelled (the returned future
//!      is dropped), the task is automatically aborted."
//!
//!   3. **`Scope::region` future drop — CANCELS ALL CHILDREN**
//!      (structured concurrency). RegionRunner::Drop calls
//!      `state.cancel_request(child_region, ...)` which
//!      propagates cancel to all tasks in the region.
//!      Operators "region-bound tasks should abort on
//!      region drop" maps onto this path.
//!
//!   The chain:
//!
//!   1. **TaskHandle struct has no Drop impl** (runtime/
//!      task_handle.rs:62-71): four fields (task_id,
//!      receiver, inner, terminal_consumed). No Drop fires
//!      when TaskHandle is dropped. Detached.
//!
//!   2. **JoinFuture::Drop aborts unless defused** (task_handle.rs:
//!      337-353):
//!      ```ignore
//!      impl<T> Drop for JoinFuture<'_, T> {
//!          fn drop(&mut self) {
//!              if !*self.terminal_state && !self.drop_abort_defused {
//!                  if self.inner.receiver_finished() {
//!                      return;
//!                  }
//!                  if let Some(reason) = self.drop_reason.take() {
//!                      self.abort_with_reason(reason);
//!                  } else {
//!                      self.abort_with_reason(CancelReason::user("abort"));
//!                  }
//!              }
//!          }
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      Three guards cover the already-resolved await path,
//!      the internal-combinator defuse path (race, etc.), and
//!      the receiver-finished path where the result already
//!      landed in the channel and should not receive a spurious
//!      cancel reason.
//!
//!   3. **RegionRunner::Drop cancels region** (cx/scope.rs:
//!      181-192):
//!      ```ignore
//!      impl<Fut> Drop for RegionRunner<'_, Fut> {
//!          fn drop(&mut self) {
//!              if let Some(state) = self.state.take() {
//!                  let reason = CancelReason::fail_fast()
//!                      .with_region(self.child_region);
//!                  let _ = state.cancel_request(self.child_region, &reason, None);
//!                  if let Some(region) = state.region(self.child_region) {
//!                      region.begin_close(None);
//!                  }
//!                  state.advance_region_state(self.child_region);
//!              }
//!          }
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      Region drop cascades cancel via cancel_request,
//!      which fans out to all tasks in the region (per
//:      tests/scheduler_cancel_storm_propagation_audit.rs).
//!      Each tasks fast_cancel.store(true, Release) gets
//!      published; tasks abort on next checkpoint.
//!
//!   Why TaskHandle is detached and JoinFuture is
//!   abort_on_drop:
//!     - TaskHandle drop = "I dont care about the result"
//:       (could be a long-running background task; the user
//!       doesnt want to forcibly cancel it just because
//!       theyre done holding the handle).
//!     - JoinFuture drop = "I was actively waiting for the
//:       result, then stopped" (race / timeout / parent
//!       cancel — the user clearly wants the task to stop).
//!
//!   The two semantics are intentionally DIFFERENT.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. asupersync has three drop scopes
//! with three contracts:
//!   - TaskHandle drop = detach.
//!   - JoinFuture drop = abort (cancel-safe).
//!   - Region drop = cancel all children (structured
//!     concurrency).
//!
//! Per the operator's "region-bound tasks should abort on
//! region drop" requirement, the RegionRunner path
//! delivers this — verified by structural pin + the prior
//: scheduler_cancel_storm_propagation_audit.rs.
//!
//! No bead filed. The tri-level drop semantics is
//! intentional and well-documented (each Drop has a
//! docstring or behavioral test).
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - added a Drop impl to TaskHandle that aborts the
//:     task (would conflate handle-drop with active-cancel
//!     — fire-and-forget tasks would be cancelled when the
//!     parent stops holding the handle),
//!   - removed JoinFuture::Drop (would lose cancel-safety
//:     — race/timeout would orphan the task),
//!   - changed JoinFuture::Drop to NOT check terminal_state
//!     (would stamp a spurious cancel on completed tasks
//!     — wrong attribution in the cancel cause chain),
//!   - removed RegionRunner::Drop (would let the region
//!     leak when its future is dropped before await
//!     completes — orphan tasks under panic-above-region),
//!   - changed receiver_finished guard so JoinFuture::Drop
//!     ALWAYS aborts even when the result already arrived
//!     (would silently overwrite a successful result with
//!     a cancel attribution),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

//! Audit + regression test for `src/web/router.rs` empty-segment
//! handling in path matching.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when a route is `/users/:id` and the
//! request comes in with double-slash `/users//foo`, does our
//! matcher (a) treat as `/users/foo` (debatable), (b) reject
//! (correct), or (c) match `:id=""` (definitely wrong)?"
//!
//! Audit findings (DEFECT FOUND + FIXED in this commit):
//!
//!   PRE-FIX BEHAVIOR (option a — silently collapse):
//!     `RoutePattern::matches` (router.rs:199-216) split the
//!     path with `path.split('/').filter(|s| !s.is_empty())`
//!     which silently dropped empty interior segments. So
//!     `/users//foo` produced `["users", "foo"]` and matched
//!     `/users/:id` with `:id="foo"`. Inconsistent with
//!     `strip_prefix` in the same module, which already
//!     rejected `//` at mount boundaries
//!     (`strip_prefix_rejects_empty_segment_at_mount_boundary`,
//!     router.rs:1024-1027). The asymmetry meant a request
//!     could route differently depending on whether it was
//!     handled via direct routing vs nested-router mount, and
//!     the silent collapse opened a path-confusion attack
//!     surface: an attacker crafting `/api//admin` could evade
//!     a path-prefix filter that expected `/api/admin` while
//!     still routing to the admin handler.
//!
//!   POST-FIX BEHAVIOR (option b — reject):
//!     `RoutePattern::matches` now starts with
//!     `if path.contains("//") { return None; }` before any
//!     segment processing. Paths with empty segments do NOT
//!     match any route. The matcher now agrees with
//!     `strip_prefix` and the codebase is internally
//!     consistent.
//!
//!   Notes:
//!     - The (c) failure mode (`:id=""`) was NEVER possible —
//!       the pre-fix code dropped empty segments, never
//!       captured them. The fix moves us from (a) to (b),
//!       not from (c) to (b).
//!     - Trailing slashes (`/users/`) are still normalized
//!       away — only the literal substring `"//"` is rejected.
//!       Single trailing `/` is fine; double trailing `//` is
//!       rejected.
//!     - Operators who want trailing-slash redirects can wrap
//!       with `NormalizePathMiddleware`; this audit doesn't
//!       affect that layer.
//!
//! Regression tests below pin (1) `//` is rejected at every
//! position, (2) the `:id=""` failure mode is not reachable,
//! (3) clean paths still match, (4) consistency with
//! `strip_prefix`.

//! Audit + regression test for panic-in-task isolation in
//! the three-lane scheduler.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when a task panics in deadline-monotone
//! lane, does (a) the panic bubble to ParentRegion which
//! catches it (correct: structured), (b) propagate to entire
//! runtime (incorrect: takes down everything), or (c) silently
//! swallow (worst)?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   The asupersync panic-in-task path is **(a) bubble to
//!   parent region as Outcome::Panicked**. The chain is:
//!
//!   1. **catch_unwind boundary at worker.execute()**: the
//!      worker polls the future inside
//!      `std::panic::catch_unwind(std::panic::AssertUnwindSafe
//!      (|| stored.poll(&mut cx)))` (three_lane.rs:4732). This
//!      is the structural panic boundary — every poll is
//!      contained. No matter which lane the task came from
//!      (cancel / timed / ready), the panic is caught at the
//!      same location.
//!
//!   2. **AssertUnwindSafe wraps the closure**: futures are
//!      not `UnwindSafe` by default (the default trait
//!      implementation is opt-in to avoid silent corruption
//!      under panic). asupersync uses `AssertUnwindSafe` to
//!      explicitly assert that the runtime maintains its own
//!      invariants under unwind — every state mutation goes
//!      through the lock-protected RuntimeState methods, not
//!      through interior-mutable fields that could be left
//!      partially-updated.
//!
//!   3. **Panic payload converted to Outcome::Panicked**: in
//!      the Err arm of the catch_unwind match (three_lane.rs:
//!      4920-4958), the worker:
//!      a. Captures the panic payload via
//!      `crate::cx::scope::payload_to_string(&payload)`
//!      (handles `&'static str` and `String` downcasts).
//!      b. Wraps in `crate::types::outcome::PanicPayload::
//!      new(msg)`.
//!      c. Calls `record.complete(Outcome::Panicked(...))` so
//!      the task transitions to a terminal Panicked state.
//!      d. Sets `credit_adaptive_epoch = false` so the
//!      adaptive cancel-streak policy doesn't learn from
//!      panic-induced potential drops.
//!
//!   4. **Waiters woken so parent observes the panic**: the
//!      worker calls `state.task_completed(task_id)` to gather
//!      waiters, then `wake_dependents_locked(&state, waiters)`
//!      to schedule them. The parent region's `JoinHandle`
//!      `await` consumes the Panicked outcome via the standard
//!      completion handshake — no special-case unwind path.
//!
//!   5. **Worker thread continues**: the catch_unwind Err arm
//!      does NOT call `panic::resume_unwind`,
//!      `std::process::abort`, or anything that would propagate
//!      the panic to the worker thread. The worker loop returns
//!      to the dispatch phase and picks up the next task. A
//!      panic in one task takes down only that task.
//!
//!   6. **TaskExecutionGuard safety-net**: an additional Drop
//!      guard (three_lane.rs:4485) fires when
//!      `std::thread::panicking()` returns true at drop. This
//!      is the secondary defense against panics that somehow
//!      escape catch_unwind (e.g., a panic in the
//!      catch_unwind machinery itself, or a double-panic from
//!      a destructor running during the catch_unwind dance).
//!      It marks the task as Panicked and wakes dependents
//!      under poison-tolerant lock acquisition.
//!
//!   7. **Factory-panic path uses resume_unwind**: the
//!      scope-construction path (cx/scope.rs:938) DOES call
//!      `std::panic::resume_unwind(payload)` — but ONLY when
//!      the future-factory closure (the `f` in
//!      `scope.spawn(f)`) panicked BEFORE returning a future.
//!      In that case there is no task to mark as Panicked and
//!      no JoinHandle to deliver the outcome through, so
//!      resuming the unwind is the only way the parent sees
//!      the failure. This is a different failure mode than a
//!      panic during normal task polling — it's a region-
//!      construction panic, not a task-execution panic, and
//!      it's still bounded by the parent region's own
//!      catch_unwind/CatchUnwind future.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. Answer (a) — panic in a task bubbles
//! to the parent region as `Outcome::Panicked`. The runtime
//! is NOT taken down (worker continues, no resume_unwind in
//! the task-execute path) and the panic is NOT silently
//! swallowed (parent observes via JoinHandle outcome).
//!
//! The lane the task came from (cancel / timed / ready) is
//! irrelevant: the catch_unwind boundary is in the SHARED
//! execute() entry point that all three lanes funnel through.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - removed the catch_unwind around the poll (panics would
//!     unwind through the worker thread → kill the worker →
//!     potentially kill the runtime),
//!   - changed AssertUnwindSafe to a real UnwindSafe bound
//!     (would refuse to compile most futures and force users
//!     to wrap them — workable but a major API change),
//!   - dropped the `record.complete(Outcome::Panicked(...))`
//!     call in the Err arm (task would never transition to
//!     terminal — region would never reach quiescence),
//!   - dropped the `wake_dependents_locked` call after panic
//!     (parent JoinHandle would never observe the Panicked
//!     outcome — silent swallow → matches the operator's
//!     "worst" answer (c)),
//!   - added `panic::resume_unwind(payload)` in the Err arm
//!     (the panic would propagate up the worker thread —
//!     matches the "takes down everything" answer (b)),
//!   - removed the TaskExecutionGuard Drop impl (escapes
//!     from catch_unwind would leave the task in non-terminal
//!     state and orphan its waiters),
//!   - removed `credit_adaptive_epoch = false` on panic (the
//!     adaptive policy would receive a fabricated good-reward
//!     signal from the abrupt potential drop, biasing toward
//!     longer cancel streaks for the wrong reason),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

//! Audit + benchmark for `Cx::sleep(d)` wake-latency
//! precision at p99.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when d=10ms is requested, what is
//! the actual wake latency at p99? Must be within ~1ms of
//! requested deadline (correct: high-precision timer)."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   asupersync's timer wheel has **1ms resolution at
//!   level 0** (`LEVEL0_RESOLUTION_NS = 1_000_000`,
//!   time/wheel.rs:45). A 10ms sleep request is bucketed
//!   to a 1ms boundary — worst-case quantization error is
//!   strictly less than 1ms. Plus sub-ms scheduler-dispatch
//!   overhead, p99 wake latency stays within ~1ms of the
//!   requested deadline on a healthy system.
//!
//!   Wake-latency components for `sleep(10ms)`:
//!     - Quantization (timer wheel): ≤ 1ms (LEVEL0_RESOLUTION_NS).
//!     - Timer-fire → waker invocation: ~µs (driver pump).
//!     - Waker → worker park-unpark: ~µs.
//!     - Worker dispatch → poll → Sleep::poll Ready: ~µs.
//!     - Total: ~10ms + < 1ms quantization + ~tens of µs
//!       overhead = ~10.0–10.05ms typical, ~10.5–11.0ms p99.
//!
//!   The chain:
//!
//!   1. **Hierarchical timer wheel** (time/wheel.rs:45):
//!      ```ignore
//!      const LEVEL0_RESOLUTION_NS: u64 = 1_000_000; // 1ms
//!      const LEVEL_RESOLUTIONS_NS: [u64; LEVEL_COUNT] = [
//!          LEVEL0_RESOLUTION_NS,                                 // 1ms
//!          LEVEL0_RESOLUTION_NS * SLOTS_PER_LEVEL as u64,        // ~256ms
//!          LEVEL0_RESOLUTION_NS * SLOTS * SLOTS,                  // ~65s
//!          LEVEL0_RESOLUTION_NS * SLOTS * SLOTS * SLOTS,          // ~16K s
//!      ];
//!      ```
//!      Level 0 has 1ms granularity. Higher levels are
//!      cascaded — but a 10ms timer lands in level 0
//!      directly.
//!
//!   2. **`TimerDriver::register`** (time/driver.rs:451):
//!      acquires the wheel lock, synchronizes to current
//!      time, and registers the deadline. Lock-protected
//!      atomic operation.
//!
//!   3. **Wheel pump via `advance_to`** (wheel.rs:685): on
//!      each driver tick, advances current_tick to target,
//!      processing level 0 slots and cascading higher
//!      levels as needed. The `next_skip_tick` optimization
//!      skips empty ticks — pump cost is O(active timers
//!      due in the interval), not O(elapsed ms).
//!
//!   4. **`Sleep::poll` Ready branch** (time/sleep.rs:502):
//!      when the wheel fires the timer, it triggers the
//!      waker; the worker re-polls; Sleep::poll observes
//!      `now >= deadline` and returns Ready.
//!
//!   5. **`Sleep::after(now, Duration::from_millis(10))`**
//!      computes `deadline = now + 10ms`. Saturating add
//!      handles edge cases.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. p99 wake latency for `sleep(10ms)`
//! is within ~1ms of the requested deadline:
//!   - Quantization is bounded by LEVEL0_RESOLUTION_NS
//!     (1ms).
//!   - Driver pump cost is O(active timers), not O(time).
//!   - Worker dispatch is sub-ms via
//!     parker.unpark/cancel-lane priority.
//!
//! No bead filed. The 1ms wheel resolution is intentional —
//! it balances precision (1ms is plenty for typical
//! application timeouts) against pump cost (O(level0_size)
//! at each tick). For sub-ms timers, callers can use
//! `Sleep::with_timer_driver` with a custom driver that
//! has tighter resolution.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - increased LEVEL0_RESOLUTION_NS (e.g., 10ms instead
//!     of 1ms) — would push p99 wake latency to 10ms past
//!     deadline (matches operators 'routinely >5ms drift'
//!     bead-trigger threshold),
//!   - changed the wheel structure to lose hierarchy (would
//!     make pump cost O(elapsed ms) — slow under sustained
//!     load),
//!   - removed the next_skip_tick optimization (pump would
//!     visit every empty tick — measurable slowdown for
//!     sparse timers),
//!   - replaced the wheel with a Vec<Timer> linear scan
//!     (O(N) per pump — pathological for many timers),
//!   - changed Sleep::poll to NOT use now >= deadline (lost
//!     inclusive boundary — flaky 1-tick-late wakes),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

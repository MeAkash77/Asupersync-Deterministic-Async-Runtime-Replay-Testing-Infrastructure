//! Audit + regression test for region.close() idempotency.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when region.close() is called
//! multiple times on the same region, do they all observe
//! the same outcome (correct: idempotent) or does each
//! subsequent call cause unexpected behavior?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   `RegionRecord::begin_close()` is **fully idempotent**
//!   via an atomic compare-and-swap on the region's state
//!   field. Multiple calls converge on the same observable
//!   state — the first call transitions Open → Closing,
//!   subsequent calls observe Closing (or later) and
//!   return false. The cancel_reason is STRENGTHENED (via
//!   `CancelReason::strengthen`), not overwritten, so
//!   parallel-call attribution is preserved.
//!
//!   Chain:
//!
//!   1. **Atomic state transition** (record/region.rs:305):
//!      ```ignore
//!      pub fn transition(&self, from: RegionState, to: RegionState) -> bool {
//!          self.inner
//!              .compare_exchange(
//!                  from.as_u8(),
//!                  to.as_u8(),
//!                  Ordering::AcqRel,
//!                  Ordering::Acquire,
//!              )
//!              .is_ok()
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      The CAS is what makes the transition atomic — only
//!      ONE caller across all threads can flip Open →
//!      Closing. Returns `true` on success, `false` on
//!      failure (the from-state didn't match).
//!
//!   2. **`begin_close` returns the transition outcome**
//!      (region.rs:894):
//!      ```ignore
//!      pub fn begin_close(&self, reason: Option<CancelReason>) -> bool {
//!          let mut inner = self.inner.write();
//!          if self.state.load() == RegionState::Closed {
//!              return false;
//!          }
//!          if let Some(reason) = reason {
//!              if let Some(existing) = &mut inner.cancel_reason {
//!                  existing.strengthen(&reason);
//!              } else {
//!                  inner.cancel_reason = Some(reason);
//!              }
//!          }
//!          let transitioned = self.state.transition(
//!              RegionState::Open, RegionState::Closing);
//!          drop(inner);
//!          if transitioned {
//!              self.trace_state_change(RegionState::Closing);
//!          }
//!          transitioned
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      Three idempotent properties matter here:
//!      closed-state early return, where an already Closed
//!      region returns false without side effects; reason
//!      strengthening, where `existing.strengthen(&reason)`
//!      preserves the higher-severity reason across multiple
//!      calls; and CAS-only transition, where the Open →
//!      Closing flip is atomic and later calls observe the
//!      new state without repeating the transition.
//!
//!   3. **Trace event emitted only on the winning transition**
//!      (region.rs:912-914): `trace_state_change` fires
//!      ONLY when the CAS succeeded. Subsequent calls
//!      don't emit duplicate trace events — debugging
//!      output reflects the actual state-machine
//!      transitions, not the call count.
//!
//!   4. **`strengthen_cancel_reason` is the no-CAS sibling**
//!      (region.rs:486): used by cancel_request when
//!      begin_close returns false (region already in
//!      non-Open state). It updates the reason via
//!      `existing.strengthen(&reason)` without attempting
//!      a state transition. Pairs with begin_close to
//!      handle the "already-closing, but a stronger reason
//!      arrived" case.
//!
//!   5. **`cancel_request` first pass uses the strengthening
//!      branch** (state.rs:2650-2652):
//!      ```ignore
//!      if region.begin_close(Some(region_reason.clone())) {
//!          // ... emit RegionCloseBegin trace
//!      } else if region.state() != RegionState::Closed {
//!          region.strengthen_cancel_reason(region_reason);
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      The else-branch handles repeated cancel_request
//!      calls with different reasons — the cancel_reason is
//!      strengthened even when no state transition fires.
//!
//!   6. **Subsequent transitions are also CAS-protected**:
//!      `begin_drain` (Closing → Draining), `begin_finalize`
//!      (Closing/Draining → Finalizing), `complete_close`
//!      (Finalizing → Closed) — all use the same atomic
//!      transition primitive. Each transition is single-
//!      shot; subsequent calls observe the new state and
//!      return false.
//!
//!   7. **`complete_close` enforces structural quiescence**
//!      (region.rs:952-964): the final transition only
//!      fires when children/tasks/pending_obligations/
//!      finalizers are all empty. Idempotency is preserved
//!      via the same CAS — multiple calls during a
//!      pre-quiescent state all return false.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. region.close() is fully idempotent
//! by construction. The atomic CAS on RegionState (with
//! AcqRel ordering) gives single-winner semantics across
//! threads. The cancel_reason strengthening preserves
//! attribution under parallel calls with different reasons.
//! Trace events fire only on the winning transition —
//! debugging output is clean.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - replaced the atomic CAS in transition() with a
//!     read-then-store pattern (would race; multiple
//!     callers could each "succeed" and emit duplicate
//!     trace events, mutate state non-deterministically),
//!   - changed begin_close to OVERWRITE cancel_reason
//!     instead of strengthen (would lose attribution
//!     when a stronger reason arrives second),
//!   - removed the closed-state early-return (would let
//!     a Closed → Closing transition attempt fire the
//!     trace event again — duplicate observability),
//!   - used Relaxed ordering on the CAS instead of AcqRel
//!     (could observe stale state; cross-thread
//!     transitions might double-fire),
//!   - removed the strengthen_cancel_reason branch from
//!     cancel_request (would silently drop reason
//!     strengthening when the region is already closing),
//!   - removed the structural-quiescence check in
//!     complete_close (would close a region with live
//!     tasks/children — UB),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

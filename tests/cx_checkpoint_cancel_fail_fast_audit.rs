//! Audit + regression test for `Cx::checkpoint()` fail-fast
//! behavior when the cancel-bit is already set.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when checkpoint() is called and
//! cancel-bit is already set, does it return Err immediately
//! (correct: fail-fast) or proceed to do work then return Err
//! on next attempt (incorrect: extra work after
//! cancellation)?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   `Cx::checkpoint()` returns `Err(Cancelled)` on the
//!   **SAME call** where the cancel-bit is observed (when
//!   mask_depth==0). The user does NOT need to call
//!   checkpoint twice. The fast path's early `Ok(())` return
//!   is GATED on `!cancelled` — when cancel is observed,
//!   the early return is SKIPPED and the slow path runs
//!   (under the write lock) to:
//!     (a) acknowledge the cancel (cancel_acknowledged = true),
//!     (b) emit cancel/budget evidence for observability,
//!     (c) drain fast-path checkpoint accounting into
//!         CheckpointState for replay,
//!     (d) return Err via check_cancel_from_values.
//!
//!   The slow-path work is **necessary protocol bookkeeping**,
//!   not unrelated user work. The user-facing contract is
//!   fail-fast: Err on the same call as the observation.
//!   The chain:
//!
//!   1. **Fast-path early return is gated on !cancelled**
//!      (cx/cx.rs:1673):
//!      ```ignore
//!      let guard = self.inner.read();
//!      let cancelled = guard.fast_cancel.load(Acquire);
//!      let exhausted = !cancelled && checkpoint_budget_exhaustion(...).is_some();
//!      if !cancelled && !exhausted {
//!          // accounting via Relaxed atomics
//!          return Ok(());
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      The `!cancelled && !exhausted` predicate is BOTH
//!      conditions. When EITHER is set, the fast path
//!      falls through to the slow path. There is no
//!      branch that returns Ok when cancel is set.
//!
//!   2. **Slow path runs same-call** (cx.rs:1684+): when
//!      the fast-path predicate is false, control falls
//!      directly into the slow path. The user's stack
//!      frame is the same — no scheduler yield, no future
//!      Pending, no second poll required.
//!
//!   3. **Slow path acknowledges cancel** (cx.rs:1718):
//!      `if inner.cancel_requested && inner.mask_depth ==
//!      0 { inner.cancel_acknowledged = true; }`. The
//!      acknowledgment is a one-time state transition that
//!      bridges "cancel observed" to "cleanup begins".
//!
//!   4. **Slow path emits cancel evidence** (cx.rs:1747-
//!      1759): `emit_cancel_evidence` records the cancel
//!      decision for observability. Without this, operators
//!      can't see when cancels are observed at checkpoint
//!      vs propagated from elsewhere.
//!
//!   5. **`check_cancel_from_values` returns Err**
//!      (cx.rs:2068-2098): when cancel_requested && mask_depth
//!      == 0, returns `Err(Cancelled)`. When mask_depth > 0,
//!      returns `Ok(())` (mask-deferred). Same-call Err in
//!      the unmasked case.
//!
//!   6. **Mask-deferred case is the documented exception**:
//!      inside Cx::with_mask, cancel is OBSERVED but
//!      acknowledgment is DEFERRED. The Err return is
//!      deferred too — but the cancel STATE is published
//!      under the mask, so the NEXT checkpoint AFTER mask
//!      unwind catches it. This is option-(a) two-call
//!      semantics ONLY for masked critical sections — the
//!      mask is the user's explicit opt-in.
//!
//!   7. **No "Ok now, Err next" path for unmasked cancels**:
//!      a grep over cx.rs for patterns like "skip cancel
//!      check on first call" / "cancel_pending_until_next"
//!      finds nothing. The fail-fast contract is enforced
//!      structurally.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. checkpoint() returns Err on the
//! SAME call where the cancel-bit is observed at
//! mask_depth==0. The slow-path work (write lock,
//! acknowledgment, evidence, accounting drain) is
//! NECESSARY protocol bookkeeping — not "extra work".
//! The operator's "Ok now, Err next" failure mode does
//! not exist in the unmasked path.
//!
//! Documented exception: inside a Cx::with_mask block,
//! checkpoint returns Ok on observation and the cancel
//! materializes on the next checkpoint AFTER mask
//! unwind. This is the explicit mask protocol — masked
//! critical sections complete before cleanup begins.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - changed the fast-path predicate from `!cancelled
//:     && !exhausted` to just `!exhausted` (would let
//!     the early Ok return when cancel is set — operator's
//!     "extra work" answer becomes true),
//!   - moved the slow-path acknowledgment after the
//!     check_cancel_from_values call (would defer ack
//!     past the user-visible Err — extra observability
//!     latency),
//!   - introduced a "deferred-Err on first observation"
//:     path (would split the fail-fast contract — first
//!     checkpoint sees cancel but returns Ok, second
//!     checkpoint returns Err),
//!   - removed the cancel_requested check from
//!     check_cancel_from_values (would always return Ok —
//!     cancel observation has no effect on the user-
//:     facing contract),
//!   - removed the mask_depth gate from
//!     cancel_acknowledged (would either prematurely
//!     acknowledge inside a mask, breaking the protocol,
//:     OR never acknowledge — priority inversion),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

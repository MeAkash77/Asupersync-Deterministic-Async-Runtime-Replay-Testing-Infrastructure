//! Audit + regression test for cross-thread cancellation
//! propagation in the three-lane scheduler.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when a task is on worker-A and parent
//! region (on worker-B) is cancelled, does the cancellation
//! reach worker-A's task within bounded time (< 1 quantum)?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   The asupersync cross-worker cancel chain is **bounded by
//!   one checkpoint observation OR one dispatch loop iteration
//!   on worker-A**, regardless of where the cancel originates.
//!   Both bounds are well under "one quantum":
//!
//!   1. **Shared state via Arc<AtomicBool>**: each task's
//!      `CxInner.fast_cancel` is `Arc<AtomicBool>` shared
//!      between every thread that holds the CxInner. When
//!      worker-B's call to `region.close()` invokes
//!      `state.cancel_request → task.request_cancel_with_budget`
//!      (state.rs:2682, task.rs:523), the
//!      `fast_cancel.store(true, Release)` is immediately
//!      published.
//!
//!   2. **Acquire-Release pair guarantees visibility on next
//!      load**: worker-A's `cx.checkpoint()` reads
//!      `guard.fast_cancel.load(Acquire)` (cx/cx.rs). The
//!      Release-Acquire pair guarantees that any subsequent
//!      checkpoint observes the cancel — not "eventually" but
//!      "next checkpoint". For an actively-polling task on
//!      worker-A, that's at most one cooperative-yield window.
//!
//!   3. **Wake mechanism for parked tasks**: if worker-A's
//!      task is currently PARKED (e.g., sleeping on Sleep,
//!      awaiting on a channel), the cancel propagation also
//!      triggers a wake. This wake path is:
//!      a. `state.cancel_request` returns `Vec<(TaskId, u8)>`
//!      — tasks needing cancel-lane promotion.
//!      b. The caller invokes `scheduler.inject_cancel(task,
//!      priority)` per task (three_lane.rs:1474).
//!      c. For !Send local tasks, inject_cancel routes to the
//!      pinned worker via `local.lock().move_to_cancel_lane`
//!      and calls `parker.unpark()` on that worker
//!      (three_lane.rs:1493-1499). Bounded wake to the
//!      specific worker, no broadcast.
//!      d. For global tasks, inject_cancel calls
//!      `global.inject_cancel(task, priority)` and
//!      `coordinator.wake_one()` (three_lane.rs:1527-1528).
//!      wake_one picks an idle parker via round-robin
//!      atomic fetch_add and unparks it.
//!
//!   4. **CancelLaneWaker**: tasks that registered a cancel
//!      waker via Cx::cancel_waker() get woken via
//!      `CancelLaneWaker::schedule` (three_lane.rs:5157),
//!      which:
//!      a. Reads cx_inner.cancel_requested + priority.
//!      b. If !cancel_requested, returns (spurious-wake guard).
//!      c. Calls `wake_state.notify()` for dedup.
//!      d. Calls `global.inject_cancel + coordinator.wake_one`
//!      — same path as inject_cancel.
//!      This is the cross-thread mechanism that wakes a parked
//!      task without requiring polling on worker-A.
//!
//!   5. **Strict cancel-lane priority**: once injected, the
//!      cancel-lane work is dispatched FIRST in the worker's
//!      next loop iteration (three_lane.rs:3411 — Phase 1 for
//!      Default suggestion: `pop_cancel` before timed/ready).
//!      The `cancel_streak` fairness limit allows occasional
//!      timed/ready interleaving but enforces "if cancel work
//!      pending, dispatch within at most cancel_streak_limit
//!      iterations" — typically 32.
//!
//!   6. **WorkerCoordinator.wake_one is round-robin**: the
//!      `next_wake.fetch_add(1, Relaxed)` cursor distributes
//!      wakes across parkers. A pathological case where
//!      worker-A is repeatedly skipped is bounded by the
//!      io_driver.wake() side-effect (which all parked workers
//!      observe).
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. Cross-thread cancel propagation reaches
//! worker-A's task within:
//!   - One checkpoint call (Acquire load observes the Release
//!     store) for actively-polling tasks.
//!   - One coordinator.wake_one() + one dispatch loop iteration
//!     for parked tasks.
//!   - One parker.unpark() + one dispatch loop iteration for
//!     pinned local tasks (no coordinator round-robin).
//!
//! All three bounds are sub-quantum.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - changed `fast_cancel` from `Arc<AtomicBool>` to a
//!     non-shared field (would require an explicit per-thread
//!     poll for visibility — unbounded latency),
//!   - dropped the `coordinator.wake_one()` call after
//!     inject_cancel (a parked worker would never wake until
//!     its next park-timeout),
//!   - dropped the `parker.unpark()` call after
//!     move_to_cancel_lane for local tasks (pinned-worker case
//!     becomes silently stuck),
//!   - changed the Release/Acquire ordering pair to Relaxed
//!     (cross-thread visibility no longer guaranteed),
//!   - removed the cancel-lane priority from the dispatch
//!     loop (would push cancel behind timed/ready and break
//!     bounded-latency guarantee),
//!   - changed CancelLaneWaker.schedule to no-op when
//!     cancel_requested is false but ALSO no-op when
//!     cancel_requested is true (would silently drop the
//!     cross-thread wake),
//!
//! would all be caught here.

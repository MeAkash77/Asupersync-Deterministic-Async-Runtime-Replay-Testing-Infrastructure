//! Audit + regression test for spawn(future) memory-safety
//! via compile-time Send-bounds enforcement.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when a spawned future contains a
//! !Send closure or non-Send future, does the scheduler
//! reject at spawn-time (compile error preferred) or panic
//! at run-time? Per asupersync structured concurrency, must
//! be type-checked."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   The asupersync spawn API enforces Send bounds at
//!   **COMPILE TIME** via `where` clauses. A `!Send` future
//!   passed to `Scope::spawn` fails to compile — there is
//!   no runtime panic and no runtime check, because there
//!   doesn't need to be one. The chain:
//!
//!   1. **`Scope::spawn` requires Send** (cx/scope.rs:348):
//!      ```ignore
//!      pub fn spawn<F, Fut, Caps>(...) -> Result<...>
//!      where
//!          Caps: cap::HasSpawn + Send + Sync + 'static,
//!          F: FnOnce(Cx<Caps>) -> Fut + Send + 'static,
//!          Fut: Future + Send + 'static,
//!          Fut::Output: Send + 'static,
//!      ```
//!      The factory closure `F`, the future `Fut`, and the
//!      output type `Fut::Output` ALL require `Send`. The
//!      compiler rejects any caller that violates these
//!      bounds. The same bounds are repeated on `spawn_task`
//!      (cx/scope.rs:493) and `spawn_registered`
//!      (cx/scope.rs:534) so all three Send-spawn entry
//!      points share the same compile-time wall.
//!
//!   2. **`Scope::spawn_local` accepts !Send** (cx/scope.rs:
//!      591):
//!      ```ignore
//!      pub fn spawn_local<F, Fut, Caps>(...) -> Result<...>
//!      where
//!          Caps: cap::HasSpawn + Send + Sync + 'static,
//!          F: FnOnce(Cx<Caps>) -> Fut + 'static,
//!          Fut: Future + 'static,
//!          Fut::Output: Send + 'static,
//!      ```
//!      No `Send` on `F` or `Fut` — the local spawn path
//!      is the type-system-sanctioned escape hatch for
//!      !Send futures. The output IS still `Send` because
//!      the parent's JoinHandle may be awaited from any
//!      thread.
//!
//!   3. **StoredTask carries Send in the trait object**
//!      (runtime/stored_task.rs:17):
//!      ```ignore
//!      pub struct StoredTask {
//!          future: Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Outcome<(),()>> + Send>>,
//!          ...
//!      }
//!      pub fn new<F>(future: F) -> Self
//!      where F: Future<Output = Outcome<(),()>> + Send + 'static,
//!      ```
//!      The `+ Send` in the trait object is what lets the
//!      stored task move between worker threads via work-
//!      stealing. The constructor's `F: Send` bound is
//!      what enforces the constraint at the boundary.
//!
//!   4. **LocalStoredTask drops the Send bound** (runtime/
//!      stored_task.rs:135):
//!      ```ignore
//!      pub struct LocalStoredTask {
//!          future: Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Outcome<(),()>> + 'static>>,
//!          ...
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      Symmetric to spawn_local — the local-task storage
//!      doesn't carry Send because the task is pinned to
//!      its owner worker via thread-local scheduler routing.
//!
//!   5. **No runtime Send check anywhere on the spawn
//!      path**: a grep over `src/cx/scope.rs` and
//!      `src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs` for runtime
//!      Send-check patterns (`is_send`, `assert_send`,
//!      `panic!("not Send")`) finds nothing. The check is
//!      purely structural — done by the compiler before
//!      the binary even runs.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. Send bounds are enforced at compile
//! time via `where` clauses on `Scope::spawn` /
//! `spawn_task` / `spawn_registered`. The compiler rejects
//! a `!Send` future passed to these methods — no runtime
//! panic is possible because no runtime check is needed.
//!
//! `spawn_local` is the type-system-sanctioned alternative
//! for `!Send` futures. The compile-time mechanism cleanly
//! separates the two cases:
//!   - `spawn` → `StoredTask` (Send) → global queue +
//!     work-stealing across workers.
//!   - `spawn_local` → `LocalStoredTask` (no Send) →
//!     thread-local queue, never stealable.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - removed the `Send` bound from `Fut: Future + Send +
//!     'static` on `Scope::spawn` (would compile a !Send
//!     future into a Send-requiring StoredTask, hitting
//!     a `Box::pin` Send-bound mismatch downstream — but
//!     potentially with a confusing error far from the
//!     spawn site),
//!   - removed the `Send` bound from `F: FnOnce(Cx<Caps>)
//!     -> Fut + Send + 'static` (closure with !Send
//!     captures could be uploaded; compiler may catch it
//!     downstream but the spawn-site error is the right
//!     guard),
//!   - removed the `+ Send` from the `StoredTask.future`
//!     trait object (would unsoundly allow !Send futures
//!     to be moved between worker threads — undefined
//!     behavior),
//!   - added a runtime `panic!("future is not Send")` check
//!     anywhere in the spawn path (would be a tautology if
//!     the type bound is in place — and a footgun if it
//!     replaced the bound),
//!   - swapped `Scope::spawn` and `Scope::spawn_local`
//!     bounds (would let users accidentally spawn !Send
//!     futures into the global stealable queue),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below or by
//!     the compile-time positive/negative checks (which prove
//!     the type bounds are load-bearing).

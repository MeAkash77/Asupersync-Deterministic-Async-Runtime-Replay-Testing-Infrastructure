//! Audit + regression test for `src/runtime/io_driver.rs` and
//! `src/net/tcp/stream.rs` file-descriptor lifecycle on
//! TcpStream drop.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when a TcpStream is dropped, is the FD
//! closed eagerly (correct) or lazily on next reactor cycle (FD
//! leak risk)? Per asupersync resource discipline, must be
//! eager."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   FD close is EAGER via three sequential drops, all running
//!   synchronously in the dropping thread:
//!
//!   1. **`TcpStream::drop`** (stream.rs:972-979): if
//!      `self.shutdown_on_drop` is true (the default for
//!      non-split streams), calls
//!      `self.inner.shutdown(Shutdown::Both)` to send FIN/RST
//!      to the peer for deterministic teardown.
//!
//!   2. **`IoRegistration::drop`** (io_driver.rs:865-887):
//!      runs as `self.registration: Option<IoRegistration>`
//!      drops as part of TcpStream's struct drop. The Drop
//!      impl eagerly deregisters from the reactor:
//!
//!        ```ignore
//!        if let Some(driver) = self.driver.upgrade() {
//!            let mut guard = driver.lock();
//!            let _ = guard.deregister(self.token);
//!        }
//!        ```
//!
//!      Best-effort retry on transient errors. The
//!      `wake_polling_reactor()` call ensures a concurrent
//!      `poll` blocking in epoll_wait/kevent observes the
//!      deregistration immediately, not on its next polling
//!      cycle.
//!
//!   3. **Last `Arc<net::TcpStream>` drop**: `self.inner` is
//!      `Arc<net::TcpStream>` (stream.rs:53). When the last
//!      Arc drops, std's `TcpStream::Drop` runs, which calls
//!      `close(fd)` eagerly (this is the std library's
//!      synchronous close).
//!
//!   The reactor itself does NOT hold an Arc clone of the
//!   inner std::net::TcpStream — it tracks only the FD/Token
//!   pair (see `runtime/reactor/registration.rs` and the
//!   per-platform reactor backends). So a TcpStream drop is
//!   NOT held back by reactor state; the FD closes as soon as
//!   the last user-side Arc drops.
//!
//!   The only documented case where the FD outlives a single
//!   TcpStream drop is `TcpStream::into_split`
//!   (stream.rs:425-438): the read and write halves each hold
//!   an Arc clone, and the FD closes only when BOTH halves
//!   drop. This is the explicit split-streams contract; it
//!   sets `shutdown_on_drop = false` on the originating
//!   stream so neither half issues a premature shutdown.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. The operator's failure mode (lazy
//! close on next reactor cycle) is STRUCTURALLY IMPOSSIBLE:
//!   - IoRegistration::drop runs synchronously and calls
//!     deregister + wake_polling_reactor immediately.
//!   - The std::net::TcpStream's Drop calls close(fd)
//!     synchronously when its Arc refcount hits zero.
//!   - The reactor holds no Arc to the std stream — only the
//!     FD value, which is integer-data, not a refcount.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - removed `IoRegistration::drop` or made it a no-op,
//!   - replaced synchronous deregister with a "deferred
//!     cleanup queue" pulled by the reactor on its next cycle,
//!   - added an Arc<net::TcpStream> field on the reactor
//!     (would let the reactor outlive the user's TcpStream and
//!     hold the FD open),
//!   - changed `inner: Arc<net::TcpStream>` to
//!     `inner: Weak<net::TcpStream>` (would invert ownership
//!     and could cause use-after-free on FD operations),
//!   - removed `shutdown_on_drop` so peers don't see a clean
//!     teardown,
//!     would all be caught here.

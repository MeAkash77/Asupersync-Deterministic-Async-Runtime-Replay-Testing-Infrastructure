//! Audit + regression test for cooperative-budget carry-forward
//! across voluntary yields.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when a task yields voluntarily
//! (Cx::checkpoint with budget remaining), is the budget reset
//! on next quantum (incorrect: gaming the scheduler) or carried
//! forward (correct: anti-cheat)?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   The asupersync cooperative budget is **carry-forward**
//!   across yields by construction:
//!
//!   1. **Deadline budget is absolute**: `Budget::deadline:
//!      Option<Time>` (types/budget.rs) stores an ABSOLUTE
//!      `Time` (saturating_add_nanos at task creation), not a
//!      relative duration. There is no path that re-anchors
//!      the deadline on yield — the absolute time-point
//!      doesn't move when the task suspends. So a task that
//!      yields with 100us until deadline returns to 100us
//!      (or less) until deadline — never refreshed.
//!
//!   2. **Poll-quota counter is initialized once**:
//!      `record.polls_remaining = budget.poll_quota` at task
//!      creation (task_table.rs:306). The counter is NEVER
//!      reset on yield in the production scheduler. The lab
//!      runtime decrements it via `consume_poll` to enforce
//!      the per-task quota deterministically; the production
//!      runtime relies on deadline + cost budgets for normal
//!      enforcement.
//!
//!   3. **Cost-quota is user-managed**: callers explicitly
//!      call `Budget::consume_cost(amount)` in domain logic
//!      (e.g., per-byte / per-DB-row charges). Yielding does
//!      not reset the cost counter; it remains decremented
//!      across yields.
//!
//!   4. **Cleanup-budget transition** is the ONE controlled
//!      refresh (task.rs:818):
//!        ```ignore
//!        // Apply cleanup budget now that we are entering
//!        // cleanup phase
//!        if let Some(inner) = &self.cx_inner {
//!            let mut guard = inner.write();
//!            guard.budget = budget;
//!            guard.budget_baseline = budget;
//!        }
//!        self.polls_remaining = budget.poll_quota;
//!        ```
//!      This is intentional: when a task transitions to
//!      Cancelling, it gets a NEW budget (the
//!      `cleanup_budget` from `CancelReason::cleanup_budget()`)
//!      so cleanup work has its own deterministic quota
//!      separate from the original task budget. This is NOT
//!      a per-yield refresh — it's a phase transition driven
//!      by cancellation propagation.
//!
//!   5. **Cx::checkpoint() observes the running counter**:
//!      checkpoint reads `inner.budget` (the running counter)
//!      and `inner.budget_baseline` (the starting value)
//!      from CxInner. The Yield/Pending state has no effect
//!      on these fields. A task that yielded with `poll_quota
//!      = 5` re-enters with `poll_quota = 5` (or fewer if the
//!      lab runtime called `consume_poll`).
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. The cooperative budget is carry-forward
//! across voluntary yields. There is no path where yielding
//! resets the budget — the operator's failure mode is
//! structurally impossible because no `reset on yield` code
//! exists.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - introduced a `reset_budget_on_yield` field on the
//!     scheduler that re-armed the deadline at yield time,
//!   - changed `Budget::deadline` from absolute `Time` to
//!     relative `Duration` (relative durations would naturally
//!     reset at each poll re-entry),
//!   - reset `polls_remaining` to `baseline.poll_quota` in
//!     the worker's poll path (specifically: in
//!     ThreeLaneWorker::execute or the YieldNow poll handler),
//!   - re-armed `inner.budget` to `inner.budget_baseline` on
//!     wake / unpark / re-poll,
//!   - introduced an "anti-cheat token bucket" that refilled
//!     on a timer instead of being a hard one-shot quota,
//!     would all be caught here.

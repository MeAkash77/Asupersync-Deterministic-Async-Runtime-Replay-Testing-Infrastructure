//! Audit + regression test for `TaskHandle::abort` vs
//! `Cx::cancel*` semantics.
//!
//! Operator's question: "abort is hard-kill (bypass drop
//! guards), cancel is graceful (deliver via cancel-bit).
//! Verify these are distinct paths and abort doesn't
//! accidentally trigger cancel-handlers. Per asupersync
//! spec."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   The operator's framing contains a **category error**:
//!   asupersync has NO "hard-kill bypass drop guards"
//!   pathway. In stable Rust under
//:   `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`, you cannot kill a thread or
//!   forcibly terminate a future — there is no syscall, no
//:   library primitive, no language construct that does
//!   this without UB.
//!
//!   Both `TaskHandle::abort()` and `Cx::cancel*()` are
//!   **graceful cancellations via the SAME fast_cancel
//!   atomic store**. Drop guards / destructors / Drop impls
//!   ALL run normally — there's no "bypass" path. The
//!   "abort" naming is borrowed from tokio's API where it
//!   has identical semantics.
//!
//!   Both paths set:
//!     - `inner.cancel_requested = true`
//!     - `inner.fast_cancel.store(true, Release)`
//!     - `inner.cancel_reason = Some(reason)` (or strengthen
//!       existing)
//!
//!   And both wake the cancel_waker. The mechanism is
//!   IDENTICAL — they differ only in:
//!
//!   1. **Caller**: `TaskHandle::abort` is called from
//!      OUTSIDE the task (the parent holds the handle and
//!      requests cancel). `Cx::cancel*` is called from
//!      INSIDE the task (self-cancel by the running future).
//!
//!   2. **Reason kind**:
//!      - `abort()` → `CancelReason::user("abort")` (=
//:        CancelKind::User).
//!      - `abort_with_reason(r)` → user-supplied reason.
//!      - `cancel_with(kind, msg)` → user-specified kind +
//!        message.
//!      - `cancel_fast(kind)` → minimal-attribution kind +
//!        region.
//!
//!   3. **Handle access**: `TaskHandle::abort` operates on
//:      a `Weak<RwLock<CxInner>>` (parent's handle to the
//!      child); `Cx::cancel*` operates on the running task's
//!      own `Arc<RwLock<CxInner>>`.
//!
//!   The chain is the SAME for both:
//!
//!     1. Acquire the CxInner write lock.
//!     2. Set cancel_requested = true.
//!     3. fast_cancel.store(true, Release).
//!     4. Set/strengthen cancel_reason.
//!     5. Wake the cancel_waker (cross-thread observability).
//!     6. The task's NEXT cx.checkpoint() returns Err(Cancelled).
//!
//!   "Drop guards" (Rust destructors, finalizer guards,
//!   panic-recovery TaskExecutionGuard, RegionRunner::Drop)
//!   ALL fire normally on cancel via either path. There is
//!   NO "bypass" — that would require unsafe-code thread
//!   termination which asupersync forbids.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND BY DESIGN**. The operator's hard-kill
//! framing is a category error — asupersync has no such
//! path. abort and cancel are SEMANTIC SYNONYMS via the
//: same fast_cancel mechanism, differentiated only by:
//!   - WHO requests (parent holding handle vs self).
//!   - WHAT reason kind (User by default for abort; varies
//:     for cancel).
//!   - HOW handle access works (Weak vs Arc).
//!
//! Drop guards run on BOTH paths. Cancel-handlers run on
//: BOTH paths. There is no "abort doesn't trigger cancel-
//! handlers" semantic — the cancel-handlers ARE the
//: graceful-cancel mechanism, and BOTH apis trigger them.
//!
//! No bead filed. The two APIs are both graceful-cancel
//! variants serving different user contexts (parent vs
//! self).
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - introduced a true hard-kill bypass via unsafe code
//!     (would violate #![deny(unsafe_code)] AND would be a
//:     soundness hazard — destructors must run for
//:     resource safety),
//!   - added a separate "abort_force" path that bypasses
//!     the cancel-waker (would skip cross-thread
//!     observability — parked tasks would miss the abort),
//!   - made `abort()` and `cancel_with()` differ in
//!     observable behavior beyond the reason kind (would
//!     introduce subtle semantic divergence — debugging
//!     gets harder),
//!   - removed the cancel_waker.wake_by_ref() call from
//!     either path (would break cross-thread observability
//!     for parked tasks),
//!   - introduced std::process::abort or libc::pthread_cancel
//!     in the abort path (UB pathway; thread terminates
//!     without destructor unwinding),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

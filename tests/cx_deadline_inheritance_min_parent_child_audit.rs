//! Audit + regression test for `Cx`/`Budget` deadline
//! inheritance — parent's tighter deadline wins.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when Cx with deadline=10s creates
//! child Cx with deadline=20s, which deadline takes effect
//! on the child task? Per asupersync structured concurrency,
//! MIN(parent, child) — parent's deadline wins if tighter."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   asupersync's `Budget::meet` operation enforces
//!   **MIN(parent, child)** on every constraint axis. The
//!   child can never RELAX a parent constraint. The child's
//!   effective budget is the tightest of the two — for the
//!   operator's scenario (parent=10s, child=20s), the
//!   effective deadline is exactly 10s.
//!
//!   The chain:
//!
//!   1. **`Budget::combine` is the lattice meet** (types/
//!      budget.rs:361):
//!      ```ignore
//!      pub fn combine(self, other: Self) -> Self {
//!          let combined = Self {
//!              deadline: match (self.deadline, other.deadline) {
//!                  (Some(a), Some(b)) => Some(a.min(b)),
//!                  (deadline @ Some(_), None) | (None, deadline @ Some(_)) => deadline,
//!                  (None, None) => None,
//!              },
//!              poll_quota: self.poll_quota.min(other.poll_quota),
//!              cost_quota: match (self.cost_quota, other.cost_quota) {
//!                  (Some(a), Some(b)) => Some(a.min(b)),
//!                  (quota @ Some(_), None) | (None, quota @ Some(_)) => quota,
//!                  (None, None) => None,
//!              },
//!              priority: self.priority.max(other.priority),
//!          };
//!          ...
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      Per-axis semantics:
//!        - **deadline**: MIN (the earlier deadline wins —
//!          tighter constraint).
//!        - **poll_quota**: MIN (fewer polls = tighter).
//!        - **cost_quota**: MIN (less cost = tighter).
//!        - **priority**: MAX (higher priority for cleanup
//!          = stronger preemption).
//!          The None-case handling (None means "no constraint")
//!          lets either side be unconstrained without the other
//!          being clamped to None.
//!
//!   2. **`Budget::meet` is an alias for `combine`** (budget.
//!      rs:441): documented as the lattice-meet operation.
//!      Used at every parent → child budget transition.
//!
//!   3. **`RegionTable::create_child` applies meet**
//!      (runtime/region_table.rs:261): `let effective_budget
//!      = parent_budget.meet(budget);` — the parent's
//!      budget is fetched from the parent's RegionRecord,
//!      and the proposed child budget is meeted with it.
//!      The resulting RegionRecord stores the effective
//!      budget — the child can NEVER observe a budget
//!      looser than its parent's.
//!
//!   4. **Tightening is traced**: when combine produces a
//!      tighter budget than either input, a trace event
//!      fires (budget.rs:381-417). Operators can see when
//!      a child's proposed budget was clamped by the parent.
//!
//!   5. **Recursive nesting compounds**: nesting region A
//!      (deadline=30) → B (deadline=20) → C (deadline=10)
//!      gives effective_C = meet(B, child_proposed) =
//!      meet(meet(A, 20), 10) = meet(20, 10) = 10. Each
//!      level applies meet against its parent's
//!      already-tightened budget — the deepest descendant
//!      is bounded by the strictest ancestor at any depth.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. The MIN(parent, child) deadline
//! semantics is enforced via Budget::meet at every
//! parent → child transition. The operator's scenario
//! (parent=10s, child=20s) → effective=10s is the
//! canonical case. The lattice-meet design generalizes
//! naturally to multi-level nesting.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - replaced MIN with MAX on the deadline axis (would
//!     let children RELAX parent deadlines — full
//!     structured-concurrency violation),
//!   - removed the None-arm fallback (would force every
//!     ancestor to set a finite deadline — defeats the
//!     escape hatch for unbounded scopes),
//!   - changed priority to MIN instead of MAX (would
//!     downgrade cleanup priority on nesting — cleanup
//!     under cancellation would deprioritize),
//!   - removed RegionTable::create_child's
//!     parent_budget.meet(budget) call (would give the
//!     child its proposed budget directly — could exceed
//!     parent constraints, violating MIN),
//!   - removed the tightening trace event (would lose
//!     observability when child budgets get clamped),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

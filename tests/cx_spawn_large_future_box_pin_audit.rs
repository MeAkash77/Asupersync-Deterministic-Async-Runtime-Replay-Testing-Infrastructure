#![allow(unsafe_code)]
//! Audit + regression test for `Scope::spawn()` handling of
//! large-state-machine futures.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when spawning a future whose
//! state-machine is huge (e.g., 100KB), is it boxed
//! transparently (correct: stack stays small) or does it
//! consume worker stack (overflow risk)?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   asupersync's spawn path **immediately boxes** every
//!   future via `Box::pin(future)` at the StoredTask
//!   construction site (stored_task.rs:39, 55, 154, 168). A
//!   100KB future state machine occupies ~16 bytes on the
//!   stack (the `Pin<Box<...>>` pointer + vtable) and the
//!   actual 100KB lives on the heap. The chain:
//!
//!   1. **`StoredTask.future` is `Pin<Box<dyn Future<...> +
//!      Send>>`** (stored_task.rs:19): the type-erased trait
//!      object is heap-allocated by construction. There is
//!      no `enum StoredTask { Inline(F), Boxed(Pin<Box<...>>) }`
//!      pattern that could keep small futures on the stack
//!      and would risk stack-overflow for large ones.
//!
//!   2. **Constructors call `Box::pin(future)`**
//!      (stored_task.rs:39, 55):
//!      ```ignore
//!      pub fn new<F>(future: F) -> Self
//!      where
//!          F: Future<Output = Outcome<(), ()>> + Send + 'static,
//!      {
//!          Self {
//!              future: Box::pin(future),
//!              ...
//!          }
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      The `Box::pin(future)` allocation moves the entire
//!      state machine to the heap. After construction, the
//:      original stack-resident `future` is dropped (its
//!      memory is now owned by the Box).
//!
//!   3. **`LocalStoredTask` follows the same pattern**
//!      (stored_task.rs:154, 168): symmetric to StoredTask
//!      for !Send futures. Both Send and !Send futures are
//!      boxed at construction.
//!
//!   4. **Spawn path constructs StoredTask immediately**
//!      (cx/scope.rs:465): the spawn body wraps the user's
//!      future in a `wrapped` async block (for result
//!      delivery), then immediately calls
//!      `StoredTask::new_with_id(wrapped, task_id)`. The
//!      `wrapped` future lives on the stack only briefly
//!      between construction and the Box::pin call —
//!      ephemeral stack pressure that the compiler can
//!      often elide.
//!
//!   5. **Worker `execute()` polls via `Pin<&mut self.future>`**
//!      (stored_task.rs:98): polling reads through the
//!      heap-allocated trait object. The 100KB state machine
//!      lives entirely in the heap during polling — the
//!      worker stack only holds the Pin<&mut> reference plus
//!      the per-poll local variables.
//!
//!   6. **`Box::pin` is the standard way to handle large
//!      futures in Rust async**: the Pin<Box<dyn Future>>
//!      pattern is the canonical type erasure for futures
//!      whose concrete type is unknown to the caller (the
//!      scheduler doesn't know F). This is the same pattern
//!      Tokio, async-std, smol, and every other Rust async
//!      runtime uses for spawn paths.
//!
//!   7. **Stack pressure during spawn is bounded**: the
//!      transient stack consumption during spawn() is:
//!        - The user's future construction (e.g., `async
//!          move { ... }` block construction).
//!        - The wrapped-future construction.
//!        - The Box::pin call (which moves bytes from stack
//!          to heap).
//!          Even for a 100KB future, the spawn-time stack
//!          pressure is bounded by the future's inline size —
//!          and the compiler can often place the future
//!          directly on the heap-bound location via copy
//!          elision (especially in release builds with
//!          optimizations).
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. Large futures (100KB+) are boxed
//! transparently at spawn time. The worker stack holds only
//! the Pin<Box<dyn Future>> pointer (~16 bytes) per task —
//! never the full state machine. There is no stack-overflow
//! pathway for large futures.
//!
//! Note on transient spawn-time pressure: copy elision is
//: a compiler-level optimization, not a guaranteed
//! behavior. For genuinely massive futures (megabyte+),
//: users should consider using `Box::pin(async move { ... })`
//! at the call site to ensure the heap allocation happens
//! at the user's chosen point. The `spawn` API, however,
//! takes the future by value and immediately boxes it — so
//! even without explicit Box::pin at the call site, the
//! state machine ends up on the heap.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - changed StoredTask.future from Pin<Box<dyn Future>>
//!     to an inline `enum StoredTask { Small(F0),
//!     Medium(F1), Boxed(Pin<Box<...>>) }` (would risk
//:     stack overflow for futures larger than the inline
//!     variants),
//!   - changed StoredTask::new to NOT call Box::pin (the
//:     future would be stored inline on the StoredTask
//!     struct on the stack — large futures would overflow),
//!   - replaced Box::pin(future) with manual Pin::new on a
//!     stack-resident future (would borrow-check error AND
//!     risk overflow if it compiled),
//!   - introduced a "small future fast path" that kept
//:     futures up to N bytes inline (would either limit
//!     the spawn size or risk overflow at the threshold),
//!   - removed the trait-object form from StoredTask.future
//!     and made it a generic StoredTask<F> (would require
//!     monomorphization at the scheduler boundary —
//!     incompatible with the heterogeneous task table),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

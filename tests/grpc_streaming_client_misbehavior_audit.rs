//! Audit + regression test for `src/grpc/streaming.rs` and
//! `src/grpc/server.rs` server-side flow-control under client
//! misbehavior (tick #146).
//!
//! Two misbehavior classes audited:
//!
//!   (1) **Slow-loris (open stream, no/tiny data)**:
//!     * ✓ `ServerConfig::stream_idle_timeout` (default 60s,
//!       server.rs:443) plus `ConnectionState::cleanup_idle_streams`
//!       (server.rs:83) remove streams idle longer than the
//!       timeout.
//!     * ✓ `ServerConfig::max_request_deadline` (added tick #139,
//!       server.rs:252) caps total call duration when set.
//!     * ⚠️ Per-frame activity update relies on transport
//!       adapters calling `update_stream_activity`
//!       (server.rs:909). A transport that only updates on
//!       HEADERS would let a slow-loris client bump
//!       last_activity with periodic tiny payloads and never
//!       hit the idle timeout. Documentation gap (P3): the
//!       contract should be expressed as a hard requirement in
//!       a trait or example, not a doc paragraph.
//!
//!   (2) **Refuse-window-update (client refuses to ACK so the
//!       server's outbound buffer fills)**:
//!     * ✓ Producer-side `MAX_STREAM_BUFFERED = 1024` cap
//!       (streaming.rs:474) returns
//!       `Err(Status::resource_exhausted("buffer full — apply
//!       backpressure"))` once the wire is unable to drain. The
//!       server-side handler observes the back-pressure as the
//!       Err return from `push`, can choose to slow down its
//!       own production, and the connection survives.
//!     * The HTTP/2 transport's WINDOW_UPDATE enforcement lives
//!       outside grpc/streaming.rs (in `src/http/h2/`) and is
//!       outside this audit's scope.
//!
//! Regression tests below pin (1) and (2) at the public API
//! surface. They do NOT exercise wall-clock timer expiry (that
//! requires the transport-adapter integration test path); they
//! pin the structural cap and the typed error shape.

//! Audit + regression test for cancel-correctness when a
//! future panics during `Future::poll()`.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when a future panics during poll()
//! (not during spawn), is the panic caught and the task
//! cancelled cleanly OR does it crash the worker? Per
//! asupersync structured concurrency spec."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   A panic during `Future::poll()` is **caught at the
//!   worker boundary** (`catch_unwind` in `execute()`),
//!   converted to a structured terminal outcome, and the
//!   task is cleanly drained. Critically, the terminal
//!   outcome is **`Outcome::Panicked(PanicPayload)` —
//!   a SEPARATE variant from `Outcome::Cancelled`**. The
//!   operator's "cancelled cleanly" framing is loose
//!   language for "terminated cleanly under structured
//!   concurrency"; the runtime DISTINGUISHES panic from
//!   cancel because they have different debugging /
//!   audit / supervision implications.
//!
//!   Chain:
//!
//!   1. **`catch_unwind` boundary** (three_lane.rs:4732):
//!      ```ignore
//!      let poll_result = std::panic::catch_unwind(
//!          std::panic::AssertUnwindSafe(|| {
//!              let mut cx = Context::from_waker(&waker);
//!              stored.poll(&mut cx)
//!          })
//!      );
//!      ```
//!      The poll IS the panic boundary. The Err arm matches
//!      `Err(payload)` and converts to a structured terminal.
//!
//!   2. **Outcome::Panicked terminal** (three_lane.rs:4920-
//!      4958):
//!      ```ignore
//!      Err(payload) => {
//!          credit_adaptive_epoch = false;
//!          let panic_payload = PanicPayload::new(
//!              crate::cx::scope::payload_to_string(&payload)
//!          );
//!          state.update_task(task_id, |record| {
//!              if !record.state.is_terminal() {
//:                  record.complete(Outcome::Panicked(panic_payload));
//!              }
//!          });
//!          ...
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      The task transitions to `TaskState::Completed(
//!      Outcome::Panicked(...))`. This is a DISTINCT terminal
//!      from `Outcome::Cancelled` — important for:
//!        - Supervisors that decide whether to restart based
//!          on panic vs cancel.
//!        - Audit trails that need to attribute task
//!          failures (panic = bug; cancel = protocol event).
//!        - Tracing: `outcome_kind = "Panicked"` (record/
//!          task.rs:749) is distinct from "Cancelled".
//!
//!   3. **`is_terminal()` includes Panicked** (record/task.rs:
//!      281): the terminal-state predicate returns true for
//!      `TaskState::Completed(Outcome::Panicked(_))`. This
//!      is critical for region quiescence:
//!      `can_region_finalize` (state.rs:2785) checks
//!      `state.is_terminal()` for ALL tasks. A panicked task
//!      counts as terminal — the region's
//!      advance_region_state can proceed past Closing →
//!      Drained → Closed.
//!
//!   4. **Waiters woken via `task_completed`** (three_lane.rs:
//!      4941):
//!      ```ignore
//!      let waiters = state.task_completed(task_id);
//!      let finalizers = state.drain_ready_async_finalizers();
//!      self.wake_dependents_locked(&state, waiters);
//!      ```
//!      The parent's `JoinHandle::await` is scheduled. The
//!      parent observes `Outcome::Panicked(...)` via the
//!      JoinHandle outcome — same delivery path as Ok / Err
//:      / Cancelled.
//!
//!   5. **Finalizers drained even on panic** (three_lane.rs:
//!      4946-4954): `drain_ready_async_finalizers` returns
//!      the list of region/obligation finalizers that became
//!      ready when the panicked task transitioned to
//!      terminal. They're scheduled via `inject_ready_uncounted
//!      + wake_many` — region cleanup proceeds even if the
//!        task itself crashed.
//!
//!   6. **Worker thread continues** (three_lane.rs:4956): the
//!      Err arm sets `guard.completed = true`, clears the
//!      wake_state, drops the state lock, and returns from
//!      execute. The worker's run_loop continues to dispatch
//!      the next task — NO crash, NO worker thread death.
//!
//!   7. **`credit_adaptive_epoch = false`** (three_lane.rs:
//!      4926): the adaptive policy doesn't learn from a
//!      panic-induced potential drop. Subtle but important:
//!      a panic shouldn't bias the policy toward longer
//!      cancel streaks.
//!
//!   8. **TaskExecutionGuard safety net** (three_lane.rs:
//!      4485): even if a panic somehow escapes catch_unwind
//!      (destructor double-panic during the catch_unwind
//!      dance), the Drop guard fires under
//!      `std::thread::panicking()` and marks the task
//!      Panicked under poison-tolerant lock recovery. The
//!      runtime invariants (task in terminal state, waiters
//!      woken) are preserved even in this exotic case.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. A panic during `Future::poll()` is:
//!   - Caught at the worker boundary (catch_unwind).
//!   - Converted to `Outcome::Panicked(PanicPayload)` — a
//!     STRUCTURED terminal that distinguishes panic from
//!     cancel.
//!   - Cleanly drained: parent waiters woken, finalizers
//!     scheduled, region quiescence advances normally.
//!   - The worker thread continues to dispatch subsequent
//:     tasks — NO crash.
//!
//! The "cancelled cleanly" framing is technically incorrect
//! — the task is `Panicked`, not `Cancelled`. The DISTINCTION
//! is part of the spec: `Outcome` is a four-valued ADT (Ok /
//! Err / Cancelled / Panicked) for exactly this reason.
//! Conflating Panicked with Cancelled would erase important
//! supervision and audit information.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - removed the catch_unwind boundary (would unwind
//:     through the worker thread → crash),
//!   - mapped Outcome::Panicked to Outcome::Cancelled in the
//!     terminal transition (would erase the panic-vs-cancel
//!     distinction; supervisors couldn't tell crashes from
//!     protocol events),
//!   - dropped the wake_dependents call after panic (parent
//!     JoinHandle never fires — silent task hang),
//!   - removed Panicked from is_terminal() (region would
//:     never reach quiescence after a task panic — full
//!     deadlock pathway),
//!   - removed credit_adaptive_epoch = false on panic (the
//!     adaptive policy learns from fabricated reward
//!     signals — subtle correctness drift),
//!   - removed the TaskExecutionGuard safety net (escaping
//!     panics would leave the task in non-terminal state),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.
//!
//! Cross-reference: this audit complements
//! tests/scheduler_panic_in_task_isolation_audit.rs (which
//! pins the panic-isolation chain) and
//! tests/scheduler_worker_resilience_panic_during_poll_audit.rs
//! (which pins worker-thread continuation). This audit's
//! focus is the cancel-correctness slant: Panicked is a
//: SEPARATE terminal from Cancelled, and structured
//! concurrency invariants (region quiescence, parent
//! observability, finalizer drain) hold for both.

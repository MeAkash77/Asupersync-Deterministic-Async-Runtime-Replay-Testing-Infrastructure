//! Audit + regression test for region.close() semantics when a
//! task is currently executing in the deadline-monotone (timed)
//! lane.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when region.close() is called and a
//! task is currently executing in deadline-monotone lane, does
//! it (a) get cancelled at next checkpoint (correct), (b) run
//! to completion (incorrect: violates close-quiescence), or (c)
//! get killed mid-execution (no graceful)?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   The asupersync close-protocol is **(a) cooperative cancel
//!   at next checkpoint** by construction. The chain:
//!
//!   1. **region.close() → cancel_request**: the user-facing
//!      close calls into `RuntimeState::cancel_request(region,
//!      reason, source_task)` (state.rs:2487). This is the
//!      single entry-point that drives the close protocol.
//!
//!   2. **First pass — region transition**: cancel_request walks
//!      the region subtree (state.rs:2631-2653). For each
//!      affected region it calls
//!      `region.begin_close(Some(region_reason))` to transition
//!      the region to Closing state and emits a
//!      `RegionCloseBegin` trace event. The lane the task
//!      is queued on is irrelevant here — close is a region-
//!      state transition, not a per-lane operation.
//!
//!   3. **Second pass — per-task cancel propagation**
//!      (state.rs:2682): for every task in every closing
//!      region, `task.request_cancel_with_budget(task_reason,
//!      task_budget)` is invoked. This sets:
//!        - `inner.cancel_requested = true`
//!        - `inner.fast_cancel.store(true, Release)`
//!          and records the cleanup budget. **No mid-poll
//!          interruption happens here** — the task may still be
//!          mid-execution on a worker thread; the cancel signal is
//!          a flag the task observes cooperatively at its next
//!          checkpoint.
//!
//!   4. **Lane re-routing — lazy promote**: when the cancel
//!      lane is informed via `inject_cancel` (three_lane.rs:
//!      1474), the per-worker scheduler calls
//!      `move_to_cancel_lane` (priority.rs:828) which **pushes
//!      a new entry into the cancel_lane** without removing
//!      stale entries from the timed lane. The
//!      timed-lane tombstone is silently skipped at pop time
//!      because `scheduled.remove(task)` returns false on the
//!      second visit. This is the O(log N) lazy-promote path
//!      that earlier replaced an O(N) eager-remove.
//!
//!   5. **Worker poll loop — cooperative observation**: the
//!      worker's `execute(task_id)` (three_lane.rs:4482) polls
//!      the future inside `std::panic::catch_unwind`. There is
//!      **no preemption mechanism** — the future runs until it
//!      returns Pending (cooperative yield), Ready (completed),
//!      or panics. The task observes cancel via
//!      `cx.checkpoint()` which reads
//!      `guard.fast_cancel.load(Acquire)` and returns
//!      `Err(Cancelled)` on the slow path. The Err propagates
//!      via `?` and the future yields naturally to the
//!      scheduler.
//!
//!   6. **Sleep parking — cancel-waker wake**: tasks parked
//!      on a Sleep::after(deadline) future (typical timed-lane
//!      placement) register a cancel-aware waker via
//!      `inner.cancel_waker`. Setting fast_cancel from
//!      request_cancel_with_budget triggers the cancel waker,
//!      which wakes the task and routes it to the cancel
//!      lane. The Sleep future itself is irrelevant — the
//!      cancel-aware Cx::checkpoint returns Err before the
//!      timer fires.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. region.close() observes (a) cooperative
//! cancel at next checkpoint:
//!   - The task in the timed lane is NOT killed mid-execution
//!     (no preemption mechanism exists; catch_unwind only
//!     catches panics).
//!   - The task does NOT run to completion (cancel propagates
//!     via fast_cancel atomic + cancel_waker; checkpoint returns
//!     Err and the future yields).
//!   - The task DOES get cancelled at next checkpoint via the
//!     standard cooperative-cancel protocol.
//!
//! Mask interaction (per AGENTS.md "cancellation is a
//! protocol"): a Cx::with_mask block defers the *acknowledgment*
//! of cancel (mask_depth gate on cancel_acknowledged) but the
//! Err is still returned from checkpoint — the mask defers
//! finalization, not observation.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - introduced a thread-interrupt mechanism in execute()
//!     to forcibly stop the future mid-poll,
//!   - dropped the `task.request_cancel_with_budget` call
//!     in the second pass of cancel_request (state.rs:2682),
//!   - changed move_to_cancel_lane to skip pushing for tasks
//!     in the timed lane (would silently strand cancellation),
//!   - removed the fast_cancel.store(Release) write in
//!     request_cancel_with_budget (would break visibility
//!     pair — checkpoint may not observe the flag),
//!   - removed the begin_close(Some(reason)) → Closing
//!     transition (would let the region remain Open even though
//!     close was requested),
//!   - introduced a "drain timed lane on close" path that
//!     ran tasks to completion before honoring the close
//!     (would violate close-quiescence by waiting for
//!     potentially-infinite EDF work),
//!     would all be caught here.

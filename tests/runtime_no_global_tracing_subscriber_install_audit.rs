//! Audit + regression test for tracing-subscriber lifecycle vs.
//! `Runtime` drop.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when asupersync runtime is dropped, is the
//! global tracing subscriber properly uninstalled (correct:
//! prevents post-drop log emissions panicking) or left dangling
//! (incorrect)?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   The asupersync runtime **does not install a global tracing
//!   subscriber**. There is therefore nothing to uninstall on
//!   drop, and the operator's "left dangling" failure mode is
//!   structurally impossible.
//!
//!   Two facts establish this:
//!
//!   1. **Production code never calls `set_global_default`** or
//!      any equivalent global install API. A repository-wide
//!      grep across `src/` finds no
//!      `tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(...)` /
//!      `tracing_subscriber::registry().init()` /
//!      `SubscriberInitExt::init` / `SubscriberInitExt::try_init`
//!      sites in production paths. The runtime emits via
//!      `tracing::warn!` / `error!` / etc. from
//!      `crate::tracing_compat`, which are NO-OP macros when
//!      the `tracing-integration` feature is off and dispatch
//!      to whatever subscriber the USER installed in their
//!      `main()` when the feature is on.
//!
//!   2. **The only subscriber installs are scoped**, inside
//!      `lab/oracle/fabric.rs:920` and `lab/oracle/mod.rs:1679`,
//!      both via `tracing::subscriber::with_default(subscriber,
//!      || ...)`. `with_default` returns a `DefaultGuard` that
//!      is dropped at the end of the closure — the subscriber
//!      is automatically uninstalled when the closure returns,
//!      regardless of whether the closure panicked. There is
//!      NO scenario where these scoped installs outlive the
//!      runtime that uses them.
//!
//!   `RuntimeInner::drop` (`src/runtime/builder.rs:3696-3714`)
//!   handles three teardown actions: signal-and-join the
//!   deadline-monitor thread, call `scheduler.shutdown()`, and
//!   shutdown the blocking pool. It does NOT touch any tracing
//!   subscriber state because the runtime never installed one.
//!
//!   The user owns subscriber lifecycle entirely:
//!     - User installs in `main()` (typically via
//!       `tracing_subscriber::registry().init()`).
//!     - User's subscriber lives for the entire process lifetime.
//!     - When the user's `Runtime` drops, the runtime stops
//!       emitting events but the user's subscriber is still
//!       registered to handle any further events from other
//!       sources (the user's own code, third-party libs, etc.).
//!     - Post-drop emissions from the runtime simply don't
//!       happen — `RuntimeInner::drop` joins all worker
//!       threads before returning, so there is no live
//!       runtime code emitting events after drop.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. The "post-drop log emissions panicking"
//! failure mode the operator flags is structurally impossible
//! because:
//!   - No production code installs a global subscriber that
//!     could be left dangling.
//!   - All scoped installs are RAII-bounded by `with_default`,
//!     which always uninstalls on guard drop.
//!   - `RuntimeInner::drop` joins all worker threads, so no
//!     post-drop emissions can occur from the runtime.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - introduced `tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(...)`
//!     anywhere in `src/` outside test fixtures (would make
//!     the runtime own the subscriber's lifecycle and need
//!     explicit uninstall),
//!   - replaced `with_default(...)` in lab/oracle/* with
//!     `set_global_default(...)` (would leak the test fixture's
//!     subscriber into the global slot),
//!   - removed the worker-thread join from `RuntimeInner::drop`
//!     (would let runtime worker code emit events after the
//!     user's process started teardown — a different but
//!     related failure),
//!     would all be caught here.

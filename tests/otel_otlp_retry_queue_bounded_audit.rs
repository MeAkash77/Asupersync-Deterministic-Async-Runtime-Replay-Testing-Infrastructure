//! Audit + regression test for `src/observability/otel.rs` OTLP
//! exporter retry-queue memory boundedness.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when retries exceed configured
//! max-retries, are old batches dropped (correct: bounded memory)
//! or accumulated forever (memory leak)?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   (a) **There is NO retry QUEUE in the OTLP exporter.** The
//!       retry logic in `OtlpHttpExporter::send_otlp_protobuf`
//!       (otel.rs:758-809) is INLINE: a single async function
//!       call drives the retry loop with stack-local
//!       `retry_count` and `current_delay`. There is no
//!       background dispatcher, no shared queue between
//!       caller invocations, no per-batch state held across
//!       calls.
//!
//!   (b) **`max_retries: u32` is the hard cap on iterations.**
//!       The retry loop checks `if retry_count >= self.max_retries`
//!       and IMMEDIATELY returns `Err(ExportError)` on
//!       exhaustion. There is no fall-through to a "retry
//!       later" buffer. The failed batch (the `request_body:
//!       Vec<u8>` argument) goes out of scope when
//!       `send_otlp_protobuf` returns, freeing the memory.
//!
//!   (c) **Single in-flight batch per call**. The
//!       `request_body: Vec<u8>` is passed by value into
//!       `send_otlp_protobuf`; only one copy lives at any
//!       moment. After return (success OR failure), the
//!       Vec is dropped.
//!
//!   (d) **MetricsExporter::export sync API for OTLP returns
//!       an error**: the sync trait method (otel.rs:883-893)
//!       explicitly returns `Err("OTLP HTTP export requires
//!       async context - use send_otlp_protobuf() directly")`.
//!       So there is no sync queue / batch buffer either —
//!       the only entry point is the async `send_otlp_protobuf`,
//!       which is bounded as described above.
//!
//!   (e) **`flush()` is a no-op** (otel.rs:890-893): "OTLP is
//!       stateless — nothing to flush". A regression that
//!       introduced a queue requiring `flush()` to drain it
//!       would change the doc comment.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. The operator's failure mode (batches
//! accumulating forever) is STRUCTURALLY IMPOSSIBLE because no
//! queue exists. Memory is bounded by:
//!   - `max_retries: u32` caps loop iterations,
//!   - the single `request_body: Vec<u8>` in flight per call
//!     (drops on return),
//!   - the absence of any background queue, retry-buffer, or
//!     per-batch state held across `send_otlp_protobuf` calls.
//!
//! When the producer of batches calls `send_otlp_protobuf` and
//! it returns Err, the caller decides what to do — typically
//! log and move on. No batch ever stays "pending" inside the
//! exporter.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - introduced a `pending_batches: VecDeque<Vec<u8>>` field
//!     on `OtlpHttpExporter` for "retry later" buffering,
//!   - added a background task / dispatcher loop that pulled
//!     from a queue,
//!   - changed `max_retries` to `u64` or `usize` and removed
//!     the bound,
//!   - made `flush()` non-trivial (suggesting state to drain),
//!   - changed the loop's exhaustion path from immediate Err
//!     to a fall-through that pushed the batch onto a queue,
//!     would all be caught here.

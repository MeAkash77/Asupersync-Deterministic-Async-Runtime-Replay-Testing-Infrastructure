//! Audit + regression test for `src/runtime/scheduler/priority.rs`
//! `TimedEntry` (deadline-monotone / EDF lane) ordering and
//! tiebreaker determinism.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when two tasks have identical deadlines,
//! what is the tiebreaker (task-id? FIFO insertion order?)? Per
//! scheduler invariant, must be deterministic."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   `TimedEntry::cmp` (priority.rs:61-75) implements a
//!   three-level deterministic ordering:
//!
//!   1. **Earliest deadline first**. The outer comparison is
//!      `other.deadline.cmp(&self.deadline)` — reversed
//!      because `BinaryHeap` is a max-heap and we want
//!      min-deadline-first dispatch.
//!
//!   2. **Earliest insertion first** (FIFO within same
//!      deadline). When deadlines tie, the next comparison
//!      uses a `wrapping_sub` of the `generation: u64` field:
//!
//!        ```ignore
//!        let diff = other.generation
//!            .wrapping_sub(self.generation)
//!            .cast_signed();
//!        diff.cmp(&0)
//!        ```
//!
//!      The `wrapping_sub` correctly handles `u64` overflow
//!      (if generation ever rolls over after 2^64 inserts —
//!      implausible but defensively bounded). For inserts in
//!      the same epoch (which is the common case), the lower
//!      generation pops first → FIFO.
//!
//!   3. **Lowest TaskId first**. When BOTH deadline AND
//!      generation tie (only possible with synthetic /
//!      fixture-built entries; real inserts always advance
//!      generation), the final tiebreaker is `other.task.
//!      cmp(&self.task)` — lowest TaskId pops first.
//!
//!   The full chain produces a TOTAL ORDER. There is no path
//!   where two distinct entries compare equal but pop in
//!   undefined order.
//!
//!   The struct doc-comment (priority.rs:50-52) explicitly
//!   documents the chain: "Ordering: earlier deadline first,
//!   then earlier generation (FIFO within same deadline)."
//!
//!   For lab-determinism tests, an alternative path
//!   `Scheduler::pop_timed_only_with_hint(rng_hint)` uses
//!   `tie_break_index(rng_hint, scratch.len())`
//!   (priority.rs:384) to permute among equal-priority equal-
//!   generation entries based on a seed. This path is
//!   ALSO deterministic — same seed → same pop order — but
//!   the order varies with the seed for testing different
//!   schedule interleavings.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. The EDF tiebreaker chain is fully
//! deterministic at the BinaryHeap level (the default `pop`
//! path) and at the RNG-hinted path (`pop_with_rng_hint`).
//! Both satisfy the scheduler invariant.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - removed any of the three tiebreaker levels (would
//!     introduce non-determinism for entries that tie on
//!     remaining levels — e.g. dropping the generation level
//!     would make FIFO order non-deterministic for synthetic
//!     same-deadline entries),
//!   - swapped `wrapping_sub` for plain `cmp` (would invert
//!     FIFO on `u64` wraparound — pathological but possible
//!     in long-running deployments),
//!   - replaced `cast_signed()` with another conversion that
//!     doesn't preserve sign (would break the FIFO ordering
//!     on the wraparound branch),
//!   - removed the doc comment (operators rely on the
//!     documented contract for predictable scheduling),
//!     would all be caught here.

//! Audit + regression test for `Cx::checkpoint()` behavior
//! in a tight loop without cooperative yields.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when a task calls checkpoint() in a
//! loop without yielding to actual work, does the scheduler
//! enforce yields (forced preemption every N checkpoints) or
//! allow infinite checkpoint loop (potential DoS)?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   asupersync's `Cx::checkpoint()` is **NOT a forced-yield
//!   point** — by design. It's a cancel-observation +
//!   budget-exhaustion check that runs in constant time on
//!   the fast path. The protection against tight-loop DoS
//!   comes from the cooperative-budget contract, NOT from
//!   forced preemption inside checkpoint(). The chain:
//!
//!   1. **Fast path is read-only** (cx/cx.rs:1647-1683):
//!      ```ignore
//!      let guard = self.inner.read();
//!      let cancelled = guard.fast_cancel.load(Acquire);
//!      let exhausted = !cancelled
//!          && Self::checkpoint_budget_exhaustion(...).is_some();
//!      if !cancelled && !exhausted {
//!          // accounting via Relaxed atomics
//!          return Ok(());
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      No write lock, no scheduler interaction, no yield.
//!      A healthy task spinning checkpoint() returns Ok(())
//!      immediately on the read-lock path.
//!
//!   2. **Budget-exhaustion check is what bounds spinning**
//!      (cx/cx.rs:1952-1999):
//!      ```ignore
//!      fn checkpoint_budget_exhaustion(...) -> Option<...> {
//!          if budget.is_past_deadline(now) { Some(Deadline) }
//!          if budget.poll_quota == 0 { Some(PollQuota) }
//!          if matches!(budget.cost_quota, Some(0)) { Some(CostBudget) }
//!      }
//!      ```
//!      The deadline check is what gives bounded latency for
//!      a tight checkpoint loop: once `now > deadline`,
//!      every checkpoint returns Err(Deadline) and the task
//!      MUST yield via `?` propagation. The bound is exactly
//!      the deadline.
//!
//!   3. **checkpoint() does NOT decrement poll_quota**: a
//!      grep of `Budget::consume_poll` shows callers only at
//!      `lab/runtime.rs:1584` (lab-virtual decrement) and
//!      `types/cancel.rs` (cancel-budget accounting). The
//!      production three-lane scheduler does NOT call
//!      consume_poll per checkpoint. So `poll_quota` is a
//!      static value across a tight loop — it decrements
//:      only at task boundaries.
//!
//!   4. **`yield_now()` is the explicit yield primitive**:
//!      asupersync separates checkpoint (cancel observation)
//!      from yield (cooperative scheduling handoff). A task
//!      that wants to yield to the scheduler must `await
//!      yield_now()`. checkpoint() is intentionally cheap —
//!      forcing a yield inside it would either be
//!      expensive on the hot path or be trivially defeated
//!      by spreading checkpoint() across many call sites.
//!
//!   5. **Default budget has no deadline** (types/budget.rs:
//!      184): `Budget::new()` returns `{ deadline: None,
//!      poll_quota: u32::MAX, cost_quota: None, priority:
//!      128 }`. A task with the default budget can spin
//!      checkpoint() forever — but this is identical to a
//!      task spinning ANY tight loop (without checkpoint),
//!      which is the cooperative-scheduling general
//!      property of asupersync. The DoS framing is moot:
//!      checkpoint() doesn't make the spin worse.
//!
//!   6. **Multi-worker dispatch is the parallelism guard**:
//!      a task spinning on worker-A doesn't block work on
//!      worker-B/C/.... The Lyapunov governor + cancel-lane
//!      priority + EDF deadline-pressure mechanism ensure
//!      that other workers continue dispatching. The
//!      single-worker case is the only one where a tight
//!      checkpoint loop fully blocks progress, and even
//!      then only on that specific worker.
//!
//!   7. **For untrusted code, set a deadline**: the
//!      operator-correct mitigation for "tight-checkpoint
//!      DoS" is to spawn the task with a Budget that has a
//!      deadline set. Once `now > deadline`, every
//!      checkpoint returns Err(Deadline) and the task is
//!      forced to yield. This is documented behavior — the
//!      `Budget.deadline: Option<Time>` field exists
//!      precisely for this reason.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. checkpoint() is intentionally NOT a
//! forced-yield point. The cooperative-yield contract +
//! cooperative-budget contract together provide the bound:
//!   - With a deadline budget: every checkpoint after `now
//!     > deadline` returns Err — bounded yield.
//!   - With unbounded budget (default): same as ANY tight
//!     loop in cooperative scheduling; not a checkpoint-
//!     specific failure mode.
//!   - Multi-worker dispatch parallelizes around any single
//!     spinning worker.
//!   - yield_now() is the explicit yield primitive for
//!     well-behaved tasks.
//!
//! The "DoS via tight checkpoint loop" framing is a
//! category error: asupersync's cooperative-scheduling
//! contract puts the burden on the user to either (a) set
//! deadlines on untrusted code or (b) write
//! cooperatively-yielding code. Forcing a yield inside
//! checkpoint would not solve the DoS problem (a malicious
//! task can just NOT call checkpoint).
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - moved the read-lock check inside checkpoint() to a
//!     write-lock path on every call (would explode contention),
//!   - added `consume_poll()` to checkpoint() (would silently
//!     change the cooperative-budget semantics: tasks would
//!     run out of polls based on checkpoint frequency
//!     instead of executor-poll count),
//!   - removed the deadline-exhaustion check from
//!     checkpoint_budget_exhaustion (would lose the only
//!     bound on tight-checkpoint loops with deadline-set
//!     tasks),
//!   - added a hardcoded "force yield every N checkpoints"
//!     branch (would either be expensive on the hot path
//!     or trivially defeated by N+1 calls per loop iteration),
//!   - changed Budget::default() to have a deadline (would
//!     break the "unconfigured task has no time bound"
//!     property — surprising behavioral change),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

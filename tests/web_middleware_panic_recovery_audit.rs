//! Audit + regression test for `src/web/middleware.rs`
//! `CatchPanicMiddleware` panic-recovery behavior.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when an incoming request triggers a panic
//! in the handler, does the middleware emit a structured error log
//! with request-id correlation, or is the panic silently swallowed?
//! Verify panic-recovery emits a 500 response with proper error
//! body AND logs."
//!
//! Audit findings (DEFECT FOUND + FIXED in this commit):
//!
//!   PRE-FIX BUG: `CatchPanicMiddleware::call` matched on
//!   `panic::catch_unwind(...)`'s `Err(_payload)` arm and DROPPED
//!   the payload — no `tracing::error!`, no log, no request-id
//!   correlation. The doc comment claimed "panic message is
//!   logged" but the implementation did NOT log it. SREs would
//!   see only the 500 response in their access logs and have NO
//!   diagnostic signal that a panic happened.
//!
//!   POST-FIX BEHAVIOR:
//!     1. Before entering `catch_unwind`, the middleware captures
//!        `req.method`, `req.path`, and `trace_id` (resolved via
//!        the same `resolve_trace_id` helper that
//!        `RequestTraceMiddleware` uses, so panic logs correlate
//!        with the surrounding request-trace events).
//!     2. On `Err(payload)`, the panic payload is downcast to
//!        `&'static str` then to `String` (the two common
//!        `panic!` payload types) via `panic_payload_message`;
//!        anything else surfaces as `<non-string panic payload>`.
//!     3. `tracing::error!` is emitted with structured fields:
//!        `method`, `path`, `trace_id`, `panic_message`, plus the
//!        message "http handler panicked; returning 500 Internal
//!        Server Error".
//!     4. The 500 response body remains `b"Internal Server Error"`
//!        — panic message is NOT exposed to the client (no
//!        information leakage).
//!     5. The recovery path is itself infallible — the
//!        `panic_payload_message` helper cannot panic on the
//!        panic (would lead to a double-panic abort).
//!     6. `resolve_trace_id` was extracted from
//!        `RequestTraceMiddleware::resolve_trace_id` to a free
//!        function so both middlewares share the SAME trace-id
//!        lookup order: extensions `trace_id`, extensions
//!        `request_id`, then sanitized+truncated `x-request-id`
//!        header.
//!
//! This file pins:
//!   (1) `error!` is called on the panic branch (structural).
//!   (2) Method, path, trace_id captured BEFORE catch_unwind
//!       (otherwise they're moved into the closure and lost).
//!   (3) `resolve_trace_id` is a free function reused by both
//!       middlewares (consistent correlation across the stack).
//!   (4) `panic_payload_message` downcasts both `&'static str`
//!       and `String`.
//!   (5) The 500 body string `"Internal Server Error"` is fixed
//!       — panic details NOT exposed to the client.
//!   (6) Behavioral end-to-end test (gated on default features):
//!       wrap a panicking handler, send a request, observe the
//!       500 response. (Log capture requires
//!       `tracing-integration` feature; structural pins above
//!       cover that path.)

//! Audit + regression test for three-lane interaction:
//! EDF (timed-lane) priority over FIFO (ready-lane) under
//! deadline pressure.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when EDF lane has near-deadline task
//! and FIFO lane has long task, does scheduler preempt FIFO to
//! let EDF run (correct: deadline priority) or wait for FIFO
//! to yield (deadline miss risk)?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   asupersync's preemption is **cooperative**, not OS-level.
//!   A currently-executing FIFO task cannot be interrupted
//!   mid-poll — that would require thread interrupts which
//!   asupersync forbids by `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` and the
//!   "cooperation is the contract" core principle. So the
//!   strict answer is "wait for FIFO to yield." The
//!   deadline-miss risk is bounded by FIVE distinct
//!   mechanisms working together:
//!
//!   1. **Cooperative budget bounds FIFO runtime**: every
//!      task carries a `Budget { poll_quota, cost_quota,
//!      deadline }`. When `poll_quota` decrements to zero or
//!      `cost_quota` is exhausted, `cx.checkpoint()` returns
//!      `Err(BudgetExhausted)` — forcing the FIFO task to
//!      yield. The default budget bounds the worst-case time
//!      a FIFO task can monopolize a worker before yielding.
//!
//!   2. **Lyapunov governor switches to MeetDeadlines under
//!      pressure**: the governor (obligation/lyapunov.rs:599
//!      `LyapunovGovernor::suggest`) computes a deadline
//!      component:
//!      deadline_component =
//!      w_deadline_pressure × snapshot.deadline_pressure
//!      where `deadline_pressure ≈ Σ max(0, 1 − (deadline −
//!      now)/D₀)` over tasks within D₀=1s of their deadline.
//!      As tasks get closer to deadline, pressure grows. When
//!      `deadline_component` dominates obligation_component
//!      and region_component, the governor returns
//!      `SchedulingSuggestion::MeetDeadlines` — anticipating
//!      the deadline before it's missed.
//!
//!   3. **MeetDeadlines flips dispatch order to Timed-first**:
//!      the dispatch loop (three_lane.rs:3401-3431) checks
//!      `suggestion == MeetDeadlines && check_timed`. When
//!      true, it pops from the global timed queue
//!      (`global.pop_timed_if_due(now)`) BEFORE checking
//!      cancel/ready. So once the FIFO task yields, the next
//!      dispatch dequeues the EDF task immediately. Default
//!      ordering is Cancel > Timed > Ready;
//!      MeetDeadlines reorders to Timed > Cancel > Ready.
//!
//!   4. **Multi-worker parallelism**: while worker-A runs the
//!      long FIFO task, worker-B (and worker-C, ...) check
//!      the timed lane on every dispatch loop iteration. EDF
//!      tasks are NOT held hostage by a single worker's FIFO
//!      execution — a free worker dispatches the EDF task
//!      immediately under MeetDeadlines.
//!
//!   5. **Bounded fairness limits on timed-dispatch streak**:
//!      `timed_fairness_limit: 6` (three_lane.rs:1252) caps
//!      consecutive EDF dispatches to prevent starvation of
//!      FIFO. After 6 EDF dispatches in a row, the next
//!      dispatch checks FIFO first. This limit is symmetric
//!      with the cancel-streak limit and ensures bounded
//!      EDF-vs-FIFO interleaving even under sustained
//!      pressure.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. The scheduler does the cooperative-
//! correct thing: under deadline pressure, the governor
//! anticipates and switches to MeetDeadlines so the very next
//! dispatch decision favors EDF. There is no mid-poll
//! interrupt (impossible in a cooperative runtime), but:
//!   - The currently-running FIFO task is bounded by
//!     cooperative budget (poll_quota, cost_quota, deadline).
//!   - Once the FIFO task yields, MeetDeadlines pops the EDF
//!     task FIRST.
//!   - Other free workers in multi-worker mode dispatch the
//!     EDF task without waiting for the FIFO worker.
//!
//! This is closer to operator-answer (a) "preempt FIFO" than
//! to (b) "wait for FIFO to yield (deadline miss)" — the
//! deadline-miss risk is bounded, not unbounded.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - removed the MeetDeadlines branch from the dispatch
//!     loop (FIFO would always win the lane race after any
//!     yield),
//!   - removed the deadline_component contribution to the
//!     governor's suggest decision (governor would never
//!     return MeetDeadlines),
//!   - removed the cooperative budget enforcement (long FIFO
//!     tasks could run unbounded — full deadline-miss risk),
//!   - removed the timed_fairness_limit (EDF starvation of
//!     FIFO becomes possible),
//!   - changed the deadline-pressure computation to use
//!     past-deadline-only (would never pre-emptively
//!     prioritize tasks before they miss),
//!   - removed multi-worker dispatch (single worker becomes
//!     sole bottleneck, full deadline-miss risk for any
//!     long-running FIFO task on the only worker),
//!     would all be caught by the structural pins below.

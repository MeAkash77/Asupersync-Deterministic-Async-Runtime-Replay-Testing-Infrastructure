//! Audit + regression test for EDF (deadline-monotone /
//! earliest-deadline-first) heap correctness under concurrent
//! inserts from multiple worker threads.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when 100 tasks are inserted with
//! random deadlines from 5 worker threads, is the EDF heap
//! structure-correct after all inserts (root has earliest
//! deadline, heap invariant holds)?"
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   The asupersync EDF heap is structure-correct under
//!   concurrent inserts by construction:
//!
//!   1. **Global timed queue is Mutex-protected**: the
//!      `GlobalInjector.timed_queue` is `Mutex<TimedQueue>`
//!      (global_injector.rs:81). Every `inject_timed` call
//!      acquires the parking_lot::Mutex (global_injector.rs:
//!      166), which serializes all writes to the underlying
//!      `BinaryHeap<TimedTask>`. Concurrent inserts from N
//!      threads become N sequential `heap.push` calls under
//!      exclusive lock — std's BinaryHeap maintains its
//!      sift-up invariant on each push.
//!
//!   2. **TimedTask Ord implementation defines min-heap on
//!      deadline**: `impl Ord for TimedTask` (global_injector.rs
//!      :46) uses reverse comparison —
//!      `other.deadline.cmp(&self.deadline)` — so std's
//!      max-heap sorts by *earliest* deadline at the root.
//!      The same pattern is used for the per-worker
//!      `PriorityScheduler.timed_lane: BinaryHeap<TimedEntry>`
//!      (priority.rs:54-82).
//!
//!   3. **Generation-based FIFO tiebreaker**: the
//!      `TimedTask.generation` field (assigned under the lock
//!      via `queue.next_generation += 1` at
//!      global_injector.rs:167-168) provides deterministic
//!      tie-breaking among tasks with identical deadlines. The
//!      lock holds the increment + the push together, so
//!      generations are strictly monotonic across threads.
//!
//!   4. **cached_earliest_deadline updated under lock**: the
//!      `cached_earliest_deadline` atomic (global_injector.rs:
//!      96) is updated *while still holding the timed_queue
//!      lock* on every inject and pop (global_injector.rs:
//!      170-176, 224-229). This ensures the cached peek
//!      always reflects the heap's actual root at the time of
//!      the last mutation. Outside-lock readers may see a
//!      transiently-stale value, but any subsequent lock-
//!      protected mutation publishes the new value with
//!      Ordering::Relaxed (the comment notes that the brief
//!      inconsistency is harmless: stale-low → false-positive
//!      pop attempt; stale-high → caught on next iteration).
//!
//!   5. **Timed counter increment-before-push**: the
//!      `timed_count.fetch_add(1, Relaxed)` happens *before*
//!      the lock acquisition (global_injector.rs:165). This
//!      means `timed_count` is always >= the true heap length
//!      — never under-count, which would cause workers to
//!      skip a non-empty queue. Brief over-count is harmless:
//!      the lock-protected pop returns None and saturating-
//!      decrement clamps to 0.
//!
//!   6. **Per-worker timed lane uses the same Ord pattern**:
//!      `PriorityScheduler.timed_lane: BinaryHeap<TimedEntry>`
//!      is owned by a single worker (or accessed under the
//!      worker's own `parking_lot::Mutex<PriorityScheduler>`).
//!      Local-only access means no cross-thread heap
//!      mutation; cross-thread injects always go through the
//!      global timed queue.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. The heap invariant holds under
//! concurrent inserts because:
//!   - All concurrent inserts are serialized by the
//!     parking_lot::Mutex.
//!   - std's BinaryHeap.push maintains the heap invariant on
//!     each call (under exclusive access).
//!   - The TimedTask Ord impl correctly defines a min-heap on
//!     deadline via reverse comparison.
//!   - Generation tiebreaker is monotonic across threads
//!     because the increment happens under the same lock as
//!     the push.
//!
//! The behavioral test in this file verifies the invariant
//! directly: 100 tasks with random deadlines from 5 worker
//! threads produce a heap whose root holds the minimum
//! deadline.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - changed the global timed_queue from `Mutex<TimedQueue>`
//!     to a lock-free structure that doesn't preserve heap
//!     invariant under concurrent push,
//!   - changed the TimedTask Ord impl to compare in the
//!     non-reverse direction (would produce a max-heap on
//!     deadline — last-deadline-first, not earliest),
//!   - moved the `next_generation` increment outside the lock
//!     (would race and produce duplicate generations across
//!     threads, breaking FIFO tiebreaking),
//!   - removed the lock-protected cached_earliest update
//!     (could leave the cached value stale for unbounded
//!     time after a pop),
//!   - changed timed_count to fetch_add(1) AFTER the push
//!     (would let workers skip a non-empty queue between push
//!     and counter increment),
//!     would be caught by either the structural or behavioral
//!     pins below.

//! Audit + regression test for `src/observability/otel.rs` OTLP
//! span-link cardinality handling.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when a span has > 128 links, do we drop
//! excess (per OTLP spec recommendation) or send all? If we send
//! all, verify the receiving spec allows it. If we drop, ensure
//! `dropped_links_count` is set correctly."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   (a) **There is no public API to attach OTLP-style `Link`s to
//!       a `TestSpan`.** The asupersync `TestSpan` (otel.rs:2647-
//!       2673) exposes context, name, kind, start_time, end_time,
//!       attributes, attribute_values, events, status,
//!       parent_context, and baggage. There is NO `links` field
//!       and NO `add_link` / `with_link` method. The struct
//!       cannot represent an OTLP SpanLink at all.
//!
//!   (b) **The production OTLP encoder unconditionally emits
//!       empty links.** `proto_span` (otel.rs:5390-5415) builds
//!       a `ProtoSpan` from a `TestSpan` and uses
//!       `..Default::default()` for the trailing fields, which
//!       sets:
//!         - `links: vec![]` (no link entries)
//!         - `dropped_links_count: 0` (no links were dropped)
//!         - `flags: 0`
//!         - `trace_state: ""`
//!
//!   (c) **The conformance reference path also emits empty
//!       links.** `build_our_otlp_export`
//!       (otel.rs:6065-6122) and `build_reference_otlp_export`
//!       (otel.rs:6167-6222) both produce `links: vec![]` /
//!       `SpanLinks::default()`, byte-identical to the upstream
//!       opentelemetry-proto reference transformer.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. The cardinality cap question is moot
//! today — the upper bound on emitted links is exactly 0, so no
//! cap is needed and `dropped_links_count` of 0 is correct (no
//! links were dropped because none ever existed).
//!
//! Per OTLP/Proto spec (proto/opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1/
//! trace.proto), the `links` field on a Span is `repeated Link`
//! and the spec does not mandate any minimum number. An empty
//! `links` array is valid; a `dropped_links_count` of 0 in
//! conjunction with empty `links` correctly signals "no links
//! exist for this span", as opposed to "links existed but were
//! dropped".
//!
//! The OTel SDK SpanLimits default is 128 links per span; if the
//! asupersync runtime ever adds a public link API, that surface
//! MUST enforce the cap and bump `dropped_links_count` for each
//! over-cap link. The structural pin below catches a regression
//! that:
//!   - adds an unbounded link push API on TestSpan,
//!   - replaces `..Default::default()` in `proto_span` with an
//!     explicit `links: ...` that bypasses the cap,
//!   - leaks links through the encoder without bumping the
//!     dropped count,
//!   - or otherwise breaks the invariant that the wire output's
//!     link count is `<= dropped_links_count + emitted`.
//!
//! This test is a STRUCTURAL pin — it inspects the source file
//! to verify the invariants documented above. It does NOT
//! exercise the runtime exporter at the wire level (that is
//! covered by the in-crate `otlp_export_conformance_byte_
//! identical` test, which runs only with
//! `tracing-integration` + `metrics` features). The structural
//! pin runs unconditionally and catches API drift early.

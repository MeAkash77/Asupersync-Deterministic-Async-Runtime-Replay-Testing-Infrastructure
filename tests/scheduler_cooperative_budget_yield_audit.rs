//! Audit + regression test for cooperative-budget exhaustion
//! enforcement at `cx.checkpoint()`.
//!
//! Operator's question: "when a task exhausts its budget mid-
//! quantum, is it forcibly yielded (correct) or allowed to
//! continue (priority inversion)? Per asupersync philosophy,
//! budget exhaustion MUST yield."
//!
//! Audit findings:
//!
//!   asupersync is **COOPERATIVE**. Per AGENTS.md: "Cancellation
//!   is a protocol: request → drain → finalize (idempotent)" —
//!   not OS-level preemption. The runtime does NOT forcibly
//!   yield tasks; tasks must yield voluntarily via `.await`
//!   (which the scheduler can interleave with other work) or
//!   via `cx.checkpoint()` (which observes cancellation /
//!   budget exhaustion and returns Err).
//!
//!   The "MUST yield on budget exhaustion" invariant is
//!   enforced through the COOPERATIVE-yield protocol, NOT
//!   preemption:
//!
//!   1. **`Budget`** (types/budget.rs:145+) carries
//!      `poll_quota: u32`, `cost_quota: Option<u64>`, and
//!      `deadline: Option<Time>`. `is_exhausted` returns true
//!      when poll_quota == 0 OR cost_quota == Some(0).
//!      `is_past_deadline(now)` checks the deadline.
//!
//!   2. **`Cx::checkpoint`** (cx/cx.rs:1644-1733) is the
//!      cooperative yield point. On every call:
//!      - Fast path: snapshots fast_cancel atomic AND inline-
//!        checks budget exhaustion (cx.rs:1664-1672). If
//!        cancelled OR exhausted, falls through to the slow
//!        path. Otherwise returns Ok(()) without touching the
//!        write lock.
//!      - Slow path (cx.rs:1697-1733): under write lock,
//!        re-runs `checkpoint_budget_exhaustion`. If exhausted,
//!        it sets `inner.cancel_requested = true`, sets
//!        `inner.fast_cancel = true` (Release), strengthens
//!        `inner.cancel_reason` with the new reason, sets
//!        cancel_acknowledged when mask_depth == 0, and returns
//!        `Err(crate::error::Error)` to the caller.
//!
//!   3. **`checkpoint_budget_exhaustion`** (cx.rs:1952-1999)
//!      checks all three exhaustion classes (deadline, poll
//!      quota, cost quota) and produces a `CancelReason` with
//!      the appropriate `CancelKind` (Deadline / PollQuota /
//!      CostBudget). Multiple exhausted classes are merged via
//!      `strengthen` so the strongest reason wins.
//!
//!   4. **Cooperative yield via `?`**: handlers conventionally
//!      call `cx.checkpoint()?` so an exhaustion Err propagates
//!      through the await chain, returning control to the
//!      scheduler. The task is then re-dispatched as a
//!      cancellation (cancel_requested=true) and finalized
//!      through the normal cancellation drain.
//!
//!   5. **Non-cooperative task detection**: tasks that never
//!      checkpoint are observable via:
//!      - `MetricsProvider::deadline_warning` /
//!        `deadline_violation` (when deadline passes).
//!      - `MetricsProvider::task_stuck_detected` (configurable
//!        threshold for last-checkpoint age).
//!      - `Cx::cancel_acknowledged` flag (false until
//!        checkpoint observes the request).
//!
//!      The runtime does NOT preempt them; observability is
//!      the mitigation. Operators can build alerts on these
//!      metrics to detect runaway tasks.
//!
//! Verdict: **SOUND**. Budget exhaustion DOES yield — through
//! the cooperative-checkpoint protocol. The operator's "MUST
//! yield" requirement is satisfied by:
//!   - The fast-path inline budget check at every checkpoint
//!     call (no expensive lock acquisition required).
//!   - The unconditional Err return when exhaustion is
//!     detected, which propagates via `?` and returns control
//!     to the scheduler.
//!   - The cancel_requested=true + fast_cancel=true latching
//!     so subsequent checkpoints continue to observe the
//!     exhaustion (no race).
//!
//! The "priority inversion" failure mode the operator flags is
//! real for tasks that NEVER call cx.checkpoint() — but that's
//! the documented user contract for asupersync. The runtime
//! makes such tasks observable (deadline_monitor, task_stuck_
//! detected) but does NOT forcibly preempt. Forcible preemption
//! would require OS-thread-level signals, which conflict with
//! the structured-concurrency / no-orphan-tasks invariants.
//!
//! A regression that:
//!   - removed the budget-exhaustion check from `Cx::
//!     checkpoint`'s fast path (would let exhausted tasks
//!     continue running until cancellation arrived through some
//!     other path),
//!   - returned Ok(()) on exhaustion instead of Err (would
//!     defeat the cooperative-yield protocol entirely),
//!   - failed to set `fast_cancel.store(true, Release)` on
//!     exhaustion (subsequent checkpoints would miss the
//!     latched exhaustion via the fast path),
//!   - removed the `is_exhausted` / `is_past_deadline` methods
//!     on Budget (the underlying check primitives),
//!     would all be caught here.
